      </p>
      <p>
       The cost of acquiring land and other property required in the development and operation of the Breaks Interstate Park and constructing, maintaining and operating improvements and facilities therein and equipping same may be defrayed by funds received from appropriations, gifts, the use of money received as fees or charges for the use of said park and facilities, or by the issuance of revenue bonds, or by a combination of such sources of funds. The Commission may charge for admission to said park, or make other charges deemed appropriate by it and shall have the use of funds so received for park purposes. The Commission is authorized to issue revenue bonds, which shall not be obligations of either state, pursuant to procedures which shall be in substantial compliance with the provisions of laws of either or both states governing the issuance of revenue bonds by governmental agencies.

       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission shall not pledge the credit of either Commonwealth except by and with the authority of the General Assembly thereof.
       <br/>
      </p>

       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       § 2. All governmental agencies of the Commonwealth of Virginia are authorized to cooperate with the Breaks Interstate Park Commission, it being the policy of this Commonwealth to perform and carry out the Compact and to accomplish the purposes thereof. The Department of Conservation and Development is authorized to transfer funds available to it to the Breaks Interstate Park Commission with the same effect as if it were expending funds on State parks. The Breaks Interstate Park Commission is authorized to exercise the right of eminent domain on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia in acquiring land or other property required in the establishment or enlargement of a Breaks Interstate Park.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       § 3. The Compact approved herein and other provisions of this act dependent thereon shall become effective upon the ratification and approval of the Compact by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and upon approval of this Compact by the Congress of the United States.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Until such time as the Commonwealth of Kentucky approves the Compact as amended by the first enactment clause hereof, the Compact adopted pursuant to Chapter 37 of the Acts of Assembly of 1954, as amended by Chapter 292 of the Acts of Assembly of 1964, shall prevail.

       Any issue of revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Director, in the name of the Commonwealth, and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company. The trust indenture may pledge fees and charges to be received from the use of and for the services rendered by any camp and recreational facilities to be acquired or constructed from the proceeds of such revenue bonds, but no trust indenture shall convey or mortgage any camping or recreational facilities or any part thereof.

The trust indenture may also provide that camping and recreational facilities shall be acquired, constructed, enlarged or improved, and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers employed or designated by the Director, in the name of the Commonwealth, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued. The trust indenture may further require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues of the camping and recreational facilities or other moneys pertaining to the facilities be satisfactory to the purchasers. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this Commonwealth to act as depository and to furnish indemnifying bonds or to pledge securities required by the Director.

     Riparian landowners.
    </b>
    - The provisions of the Virginia Scenic Rivers Act do not apply to riparian landowners constructing dams, docks, or other structures that could impede water flow along tributaries of designated waterways unless those tributaries are included within the scope of the designation. The Scenic Rivers Act does not impose any restrictions on a riparian landowner's management of surface water on his land abutting a designated waterway, and accordingly that a riparian landowner may engage in grading, plowing, timbering, or otherwise develop his property in a manner that might impede the flow of surface water across his property into a designated scenic river.

    - The provisions of the Virginia Scenic Rivers Act do not apply to riparian landowners constructing dams, docks, or other structures that could impede water flow along tributaries of designated waterways unless those tributaries are included within the scope of the designation. The Scenic Rivers Act does not impose any restrictions on a riparian landowner's management of surface water on his land abutting a designated waterway, and accordingly that a riparian landowner may engage in grading, plowing, timbering, or otherwise develop his property in a manner that might impede the flow of surface water across his property into a designated scenic river.

       Upon the creation of a district by any means authorized by this chapter, two district directors appointed by the Board and authorized by the Board to do so, shall present to the Secretary of the Commonwealth an application signed by them, which shall set forth: (i) that a petition for the creation of the district was filed with the Board pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and that the proceedings specified in this chapter were conducted; (ii) that the application is being filed in order to complete the organization of the district as a political subdivision under this chapter; (iii) that the Board has appointed them as district directors; (iv) the name and official residence of each of the district directors together with a certified copy of the appointments evidencing their right to office; (v) the term of office of each of the district directors; (vi) the proposed name of the district; and (vii) the location of the principal office of the district directors. The application shall be subscribed and sworn to by the two district directors authorized by the Board to make such application before an officer authorized by the laws of the Commonwealth to take and certify oaths. The application shall be accompanied by a certified statement by the Board that the district was created as required by law. The statement shall set forth the boundaries of the district as they have been defined by the Board.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the creation of a district necessitates the dissolution of an existing district, an application shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Commonwealth, with the application for the district to be created, by the directors of the district to be dissolved, for the discontinuance of such district, contingent upon the creation of the new district. The application for discontinuance, duly verified, shall simply state that the lands encompassed in the district to be dissolved shall be included within the territory of the district created. The application for discontinuance of such district shall be accompanied by a certified statement by the Board that the discontinued district was dissolved as required by law and the new district was created as required by law. The statement shall contain a description of the boundaries of each district dissolved and shall set forth the boundaries of the district created as defined by the Board. The Secretary of the Commonwealth shall issue to the directors of each district a certificate of dissolution and shall record the certificate in an appropriate book of record in his office.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       When the boundaries of districts are changed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the various affected district boards shall each present to the Secretary of the Commonwealth an application, signed by them, for a new certificate of organization evidencing the change of boundaries. The application shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth accompanied by a certified statement by the Board that the boundaries have been changed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The statement by the Board shall define the new boundary line in a manner adequate to describe the boundary changes of districts. When the application and statement have been filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the change of boundary shall become effective and the Secretary of the Commonwealth shall issue to the directors of each of the districts a certificate of organization evidencing the change of boundaries.

Upon receipt of the new name, the Secretary of the Commonwealth shall record the application, with the name so modified, in an appropriate book of record in his office. When the application and statement have been made, filed and recorded, as herein provided, the district shall constitute a political subdivision of the Commonwealth. The Secretary of the Commonwealth shall make and issue to the directors a certificate, under the lesser seal of the Commonwealth, of the due organization of the district and shall record the certificate with the application and statement.

The district directors shall submit a copy of the resolution to the Board and, if the Board concurs, it shall present the resolution, together with a certified statement that it concurs, to the Secretary of the Commonwealth who shall file the resolution and issue a new or amended certificate of organization.

      <p>
       Any person or legal entity failing or refusing to comply with an order issued pursuant to this article may be compelled to comply with the order in a proceeding instituted in any appropriate court by the Board. The Board shall bring suit in the name of the Commonwealth in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin the unlawful construction, modification, operation, or maintenance of any dam regulated under this article. Such court may require the removal or modification of any such dam by mandatory injunction. If the court orders the removal of the dam, the owner shall be required to bear the expenses of such removal.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Should the Board be required to implement and carry out the action, the Board shall charge the owner for any expenses associated with the action, and if the repayment is not made within 90 days after written demand, the Board may bring an action in the proper court to recover this expense. The Board shall file an action in the court having jurisdiction over any owner or the owner's property for the recovery of such costs. A lien in the amount of such costs shall be automatically created on all property owned by any such owner at or proximate to such dam or reservoir.

       As used in this article, unless the context clearly requires a different meaning:
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Continual accelerated erosion"
       means a rapid increase in the erosion rate of stream banks caused by loss of vegetation, diversion of water by constrictions, undermining, and other resultant effects of severe floods.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Natural streams"
       means nontidal waterways which are part of the natural topography. They usually maintain a continuous or seasonal flow during the year and are characterized as being irregular in cross-section with a meandering course. Constructed channels such as drainage ditches or swales shall not be considered natural streams.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Program"
       means the Stream Restoration Assistance Program.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Stream restoration"
       means any combination of structural and vegetative measures which may be taken to restore, stabilize, and protect a natural stream which has been damaged by severe flooding and is consequently subject to continual accelerated erosion or other detrimental effects. The term shall also include measures to return stream flow to its original channel in cases where the stream course has been changed as a result of flooding.

         Legislative intent.
        </b>
        - Virginia Conservation Easement Act did not create a new right to burden land by a negative easement in gross for the purpose of land conservation and historic preservation, but facilitated the continued creation of such easements by providing a clear statutory framework under which tax exemptions are made available to charitable organizations devoted to those purposes and tax benefits and incentives are provided to the grantors of such easements, contrary to the common law; moreover, the easement at issue was not of a novel character and is consistent with the statutory recognition of negative easements in gross for conservation and historic purposes.

         No abrogation of strict construction principle.
        </b>
        - In certain significant respects, the Virginia Conservation Easement Act is in derogation of the common law, but this does not necessarily mean that the common-law strict construction principle applied to restrictive covenants is abrogated by the Act; the Act does not abrogate the common-law strict construction principle as the Act is not directly and irreconcilably opposed to it, and thus the restrictive covenants in the easement that were ambiguous had to be strictly construed against restriction and in favor of the business.

         Conservation easement interpretation.
        </b>
        - By leaving the strict construction principle in force with the passage of the Virginia Conservation Easement Act, the legislature must have viewed this principle as an appropriate additional incentive for those who draft the conservation easements to achieve clarity in light of the fact that they are subject to enforcement in perpetuity, and this is equally true of the constitutional policy to protect the environment, the Open Space Land Act, the Virginia Outdoors Foundation, and the Virginia Land Conservation Incentives Act of 1999; like the Virginia Conservation Easement Act, none of these provisions address in any way the interpretive principles to be applied to a conservation easement.

       Whenever any holder as defined in this chapter, or the successors or assigns thereof, shall cease to exist, any conservation easement and any right of enforcement held by it shall vest in the Virginia Outdoors Foundation, unless the instrument creating the easement otherwise provides for its transfer to some other holder or public body.

         Local ordinances affecting silvicultural activity not prohibited.
        </b>
        - This section authorizes a county zoning administrator to review proposed silvicultural activity to determine whether it complies with applicable local zoning requirements but there is nothing in this section that suggests that such a compliance review is limited to determining whether the forestry plan complies with zoning ordinances relating to non-silvicultural activities, such as noise abatement ordinances, nor does anything in the statute suggest that a county cannot enact ordinances affecting silvicultural activity.

         Approval by zoning administrator may be required.
        </b>
        - This section authorizes a county zoning administrator to review proposed silvicultural activity to determine whether it complies with applicable local zoning requirements and this statutory review process includes a component of evaluation and decision regarding compliance; accordingly, describing the decision a local zoning administrator must make as an "approval" in an ordinance is consistent with authorizing the zoning administrator to make such a determination regarding compliance and does not create a prohibited permit requirement.

        <b>
         Local ordinance restricting clear cutting not prohibited.
        </b>
        - A local ordinance providing that clear cutting of trees was not permitted but that the zoning administrator could permit selected thinning based upon best management practices and in accordance with an approved plan was not an absolute prohibition on clear cutting of timber in areas subject to the ordinance but a limitation on clear cutting, which could be altered by the zoning administrator and, therefore, this ordinance did not contravene, and was not preempted by, this section.

         Burden not shifted to locality to prove validity of ordinances.
        </b>
        - The limitations placed on a locality's general police powers and zoning authority by this section did change the status quo and impose the burden upon localities if they enact requirements that exceed the best management practices promulgated by the state forester to show that the state regulations were inadequate to protect the health, safety and welfare of their citizens and that local regulation was necessary to meet identified shortcomings in the state program.

    10.1-1137</a></cite>, has conferred upon forest wardens the authority to employ persons to assist in extinguishing forest fires, obviously contemplating a situation where the necessary assistance can be obtained without resort to compulsion. But where the needed assistance cannot be so freely secured, the legislature, by this section, has conferred upon forest wardens the authority to summon persons to help in fighting fires, placing those so summoned under pain of prosecution for their failure or refusal to give aid.

       The judge shall cause the cash deposit or surety bond to be delivered to the State Forester, who shall hold the cash or surety bond in a special account until it is used or released as hereinafter provided.

Each seedling shall be planted in a separate hole at least six feet from any other planted seedling. Seedlings shall be planted at least six feet from any sapling or tree which may shade the planted seedling from direct sunlight. If stems of noncommercial species prevent the planting of tree seedlings in the manner herein described on any area in violation, a sufficient number of such stems shall be cut, girdled or poisoned to permit the required number of seedlings to be planted. The seedlings shall be planted during the period of the year when forest tree seedlings are customarily planted in the section of the Commonwealth in which the cutover area is located. After receipt of the tree seedlings from the nursery, care shall be taken to keep the seedling roots in a moist, uninjured condition at all times prior to actual planting, and the seedlings shall be planted in a careful, workmanlike manner. Planted seedlings shall be of the same tree species as the seed trees cut in violation, or if two or more seed tree species are cut in violation, the species of the planted seedlings shall be in proportion to the seed trees cut in violation. The above specified manner of planting and tree species planted shall be observed whether the planting is done by the person found in violation of this article or by the State Forester.

       If, upon inspection, the State Forester finds that the general cutover area or any part thereof has not been planted in the manner and during the period of year specified, or that the area has not been planted previous to one year following the date of conviction, the State Forester shall then plant the area during the next planting season, and do such forest cultural work as he deems necessary by reason of the delayed planting, keeping a careful and accurate account of all costs incurred, including a reasonable administrative cost. Following completion of the planting the State Forester shall prepare a certified statement showing the cost of planting, which shall be paid from the cash deposit, or if a surety bond has been deposited the State Forester shall collect the cost of planting from the bonding company. The State Forester shall then submit to the person making the deposit a certified statement of the cost of planting, together with any cash remaining after paying the cost of planting and forest cultural work.

All moneys collected pursuant to this subsection, exclusive of court costs and legal fees incurred by the Commonwealth, shall be delivered to the State Forester, who shall deposit the money in the Forestry Operations Fund in the state treasury until it is used or released as hereinafter provided.

      <p>
       The State Forester is authorized, upon the request of a landowner, to examine timberland and make recommendations concerning reforestation. He may make available to landowners, with or without charge, use of specialized state-owned equipment and tree seedlings, tree seed, materials, and services of specialized state personnel for the purpose of preparing land for reforestation and reforesting land devoted to growing timber, in accordance with administrative regulations.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon the completion of each separate reforestation project in accordance with the recommendations and approval of the State Forester, the State Forester shall determine the total cost of the project including money paid or payable to a contractor for services performed on the project, for labor, and for other costs incurred by the landowner, including a standard rental rate value for use of state-owned equipment and the cost of tree seedlings, tree seed, materials, and specialized state personnel used on the project.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The following incentive to reforesting land may be utilized by the State Forester: whenever a landowner completes a reforestation project in accordance with the recommendations and approval of the State Forester, through the use of his own equipment, material and personnel, or through the employment of a contractor where no state equipment, materials or personnel are used, or are used only in part, the State Forester shall determine the total cost of the project based on current commercial rental rate for machines similar to types used, cost of material, and cost of personnel where the landowner does his own work on the project, or based on the contractor's statement of cost or paid receipts furnished by the landowner where work is done by a contractor together with and at the standard rental value for use of any state-owned specialized equipment, tree seedlings, tree seed, materials, and specialized state personnel used on the project. The State Forester, from funds appropriated for the purposes of this article, may pay to the landowner an amount not to exceed seventy-five percent of the total cost of the project, as above determined, or ninety dollars per acre, whichever is the lesser.

        The General Assembly shall fund grants to finance the reasonable costs of design and installation of nutrient removal technology at the publicly owned treatment works designated as significant dischargers contained in subsection F or as eligible nonsignificant dischargers as defined in § 10.1-2117. When grant disbursements pursuant to this section reach a sum sufficient to fund the completion of the ENRC Program at all publicly owned treatment works, the House Committee on Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources, the House Committee on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations shall review (i) the future funding needs to meet the purposes of the Water Quality Improvement Act, (ii) the most recent annual needs estimate required by § 10.1-2134.1, and (iii) the appropriate funding mechanism for such needs.

Each requisition shall include written certification that the applicable local share of the cost of nutrient removal technology for that portion of the project covered by such requisition has been incurred or expended. Except as may otherwise be approved by the Department, disbursements shall not exceed 95 percent of the total grant amount until satisfactory completion of the project. The distribution of the grants shall be effected by one of the following methods:

        The Department, the Task Force and any advisory panels appointed by the Task Force shall be guided by the following definition of watershed planning: "Watershed planning" is the process of studying the environmental and land use features of a watershed to identify those areas that should be protected and preserved, measures to be utilized to protect such areas, and the character of development in order to avoid and minimize disruption of natural systems. Its focus is not on directing development to particular parcels of land but rather to identify critical resources, and measures to protect those resources, so that development, when it does occur, will not negatively impact water resources. In so doing watershed planning uses and protects ecological processes to lessen the need for structural control methods that require capital costs and maintenance. By including consideration of a watershed and its characteristics, cumulative impacts and interjurisdictional issues are more effectively managed than when solely relying on single-site-permit approaches. Watershed planning can be an important tool for maintaining environmental integrity, economic development and watershed permitting.
       </li>
       <li id="t10.1c11.1a03s10.1-1196ol1B">
        The Department, the Task Force and any advisory panels appointed by the Task Force shall be guided by the principles contained in the following statement: Stream systems tend to reflect the character of the watershed they drain. Unchecked physical conversion in a watershed accompanying urbanization leads to degraded streams and wetlands. As urbanization continues to spread across the state, natural vegetation, slope and water retention characteristics are replaced by impervious surfaces disrupting the dynamic balance of the natural hydrologic cycle. Poorly planned development can increase peak storm flows and runoff volume, lower water quality and aesthetics, and cause flooding and degradation of downstream communities and ecosystems.

Thereafter each installation shall cease to be part of a demonstration program and, in the case of a utility-owned installation, shall continue to operate as a utility-owned generating facility, and in the case of a customer-owned installation, shall continue to provide power to the utility pursuant to the terms of the agreed upon tariff arrangement. Subject to review by the Commission, such utility-owned distributed solar generation facilities and tariffs for power generated from customer-owned distributed solar installations shall be prioritized in areas identified by the utility as areas where localized solar generation would provide benefits to the utility's distribution system, including constrained or high-growth areas. The Commission shall approve such programs or distributed generation facilities if it determines that the programs or facilities, including those targeting constrained or high load growth areas, are reasonably designed to be in furtherance of the public interest.

         Definition of "wildlife."
        </b>
        - Term "wildlife" is not difficult to comprehend or unclear, and it must be construed as to its ordinary meaning; the term "wildlife" is unambiguous, the plain language of the statute controls, and "wildlife" means all living things that are neither human nor domesticated, the mammals, birds, and fishes that are hunted by man for sport or food. Karr v. Va. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 66 Va. App. 507, 789 S.E.2d 121 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court erred in allowing the interpretation of "wildlife" by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality to be given special weight on the ground that the term was ambiguous because the term "wildlife" was unambiguous and meant all living things that were neither human nor domesticated. Karr v. Va. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 66 Va. App. 507, 789 S.E.2d 121 (2016).

       <p>
        <b>
         Study of wildlife.
        </b>
        - Circuit court did not err in concluding that the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality complied with the statute, which required an analysis based on information on the presence, activity, and migratory behavior of wildlife Department found as relevant and sensitive to a small wind energy project; Department used its discretion appropriately and reasonably in its interpretation of the term "wildlife" and in its determination of the appropriate triggers for the creation of mitigation plans. Karr v. Va. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 66 Va. App. 507, 789 S.E.2d 121 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        By using the phrase "where relevant," the General Assembly intended the study of wildlife to be only of a subset of any wildlife likely to be impacted by the project as determined by the expertise of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ); when viewing the statute in its entirety, the General Assembly only addresses the onsite study of relevant wildlife, i.e ., those species that DEQ identifies as sensitive to a project of this type. Karr v. Va. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 66 Va. App. 507, 789 S.E.2d 121 (2016).
        <br/>

       <p>
        <b>
         Department of Environmental Quality has authority to determine adverse impacts to wildlife.
        </b>
        - Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) acted properly in its determination of the appropriate triggers for the creation of mitigation plans because based on the scientific data, DEQ created automatic mitigation for bats, threatened and endangered species, sea turtles, and avian species in Coastal Avian Protection Zones; the General Assembly gave DEQ the power to determine which relevant wildlife would be significantly adversely impacted by the small wind energy project. Karr v. Va. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 66 Va. App. 507, 789 S.E.2d 121 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain reading of subdivision B 8 empowers the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to determine if the information collected in the wildlife study performed pursuant to subdivision B 7 indicates that significant adverse impacts to wildlife or historic resources are likely; the statute expressly confers upon DEQ the authority to determine what constitutes a significant adverse impact to wildlife. Karr v. Va. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 66 Va. App. 507, 789 S.E.2d 121 (2016).

       - Acts 2011, c. 771, cl. 1 provides: "
       §
       1. That in order to promote solar energy through distributed generation, the State Corporation Commission shall exercise its existing authority to consider for approval, after notice to all affected parties and opportunity for hearing, petitions filed by a utility to construct and operate distributed solar generation facilities and to offer special tariffs to facilitate customer-owned distributed solar generation as alternatives to net energy metering, with an aggregate amount of rated generating capacity of up to 0.20 percent of each electric utility's adjusted Virginia peak load for the calendar year 2010. Such petitions may be made during the period of July 1, 2011, through July 1, 2015, and the Commission, on its own motion, may extend this period an additional year for good cause. Each distributed solar generation installation approved pursuant to this section shall be considered to be part of a demonstration program to assess benefits to the utility's distribution system, including constrained or high load growth circuits, for a period of five years from the date each installation becomes operational. Thereafter each installation shall cease to be part of a demonstration program and, in the case of a utility-owned installation, shall continue to operate as a utility-owned generating facility, and in the case of a customer-owned installation, shall continue to provide power to the utility pursuant to the terms of the agreed upon tariff arrangement. Subject to review by the Commission, such utility-owned distributed solar generation facilities and tariffs for power generated from customer-owned distributed solar installations shall be prioritized in areas identified by the utility as areas where localized solar generation would provide benefits to the utility's distribution system, including constrained or high-growth areas. The Commission shall approve such programs or distributed generation facilities if it determines that the programs or facilities, including those targeting constrained or high load growth areas, are reasonably designed to be in furtherance of the public interest.

       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       To the extent consistent with requirements imposed by federal law, any person making a voluntary disclosure of information to a state or local regulatory agency regarding a violation of an environmental statute, regulation, permit or administrative order shall be accorded immunity from administrative or civil penalty under such statute, regulation, permit or administrative order. A disclosure is voluntary if (i) it is not otherwise required by law, regulation, permit or administrative order, (ii) it is made promptly after knowledge of the violation is obtained through a voluntary environmental assessment, and (iii) the person making the disclosure corrects the violation in a diligent manner in accordance with a compliance schedule submitted to the appropriate state or local regulatory agencies demonstrating such diligence. Immunity shall not be accorded if it is found that the person making the voluntary disclosure has acted in bad faith. This section does not bar the institution of a civil action claiming compensation for injury to person or property against an owner or operator.

Such request shall include a demonstration that the person requesting access has used reasonable effort to obtain access by agreement with the property owner. Such access, if granted, shall be granted for only the minimum amount of time necessary to complete the remediation and shall be exercised in a manner that minimizes the disruption of ongoing activities and compensates for actual damages. The person requesting access shall reimburse the Commonwealth for reasonable, actual and necessary expenses incurred in seeking or obtaining access. Denial of access to the Department by a property owner creates a rebuttable presumption that such owner waives all rights, claims and causes of action against the person volunteering to perform remediation for costs, losses or damages related to the contamination as to claims for costs, losses or damages arising after the date of such denial of access to the Department. A property owner who has denied access to the Department may rebut the presumption by showing that he had good cause for the denial or that the person requesting that the Department obtain access acted in bad faith.

To the extent consistent with federal law, any person making a voluntary disclosure regarding real or potential contamination at a brownfield site shall not be assessed an administrative or civil penalty under the Virginia Waste Management Act (<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.010.1.html#t010.1s10.1-1400" target="_blank">§ 10.1-1400</a></cite> et seq.), the State Water Control Law (<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.062.1.html#t062.1s62.1-44.2" target="_blank">§ 62.1-44.2</a></cite> et seq.), the State Air Pollution Control Law (<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.010.1.html#t010.1s10.1-1300" target="_blank">§ 10.1-1300</a></cite> et seq.), or any other applicable law. A disclosure is voluntary if it is not otherwise required by law, regulation, permit or administrative order and the person making the disclosure adopts a plan to market for redevelopment or otherwise ensure the timely remediation of the site. Immunity shall not be accorded if it is found that the person making the voluntary disclosure has acted in bad faith.

     Purchase of contaminated property at delinquent tax sale.

    - Purchase of contaminated property by county at a delinquent tax sale may constitute an involuntary transfer or acquisition and thereby qualify the county for protection from liability under subsection C of this section, provided the county meets all conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (v) of that subsection and the site is not subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

        Subsection B of this section would provide liability protection to a third party who purchased contaminated property at a delinquent tax sale with knowledge of the contamination, as a "bona fide prospective purchaser," provided the third party meets the conditions described in clauses (i) through (iv) of that subsection, and the site is not subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

      <ol type="A">
       <li id="t10.1c12.2s10.1-1239ol1A">
        Any person, including a person that owns an interest in the real property, the agency, or a municipality or other unit of local government, may be a holder. An environmental covenant may identify more than one holder. The interest of a holder is an interest in real property.
       </li>
       <li id="t10.1c12.2s10.1-1239ol1B">
        A right of an agency under this chapter or under an environmental covenant, other than a right as a holder, is not an interest in real property.
       </li>
       <li id="t10.1c12.2s10.1-1239ol1C">
        An agency is bound by any obligation it assumes in an environmental covenant, but an agency does not assume obligations merely by signing an environmental covenant. Any other person that signs an environmental covenant is bound by the obligations the person assumes in the covenant, but signing the covenant does not change obligations, rights, or protections granted or imposed under law other than this chapter except as provided in the covenant.
       </li>
       <li id="t10.1c12.2s10.1-1239ol1D">
        The following rules apply to interests in real property in existence at the time an environmental covenant is created or amended:
        <ol>
         <li id="t10.1c12.2s10.1-1239ol1D1">
          An interest that has priority under other law is not affected by an environmental covenant unless the person that owns the interest subordinates that interest to the covenant.
         </li>
         <li id="t10.1c12.2s10.1-1239ol1D2">
          This chapter does not require a person that owns a prior interest to subordinate that interest to an environmental covenant or to agree to be bound by the covenant.
         </li>
         <li id="t10.1c12.2s10.1-1239ol1D3">
          A subordination agreement may be contained in an environmental covenant covering real property or in a separate record. If the environmental covenant covers commonly owned property in a common interest community, the record may be signed by any person authorized by the governing board of the owners' association.
         </li>
         <li id="t10.1c12.2s10.1-1239ol1D4">
          An agreement by a person to subordinate a prior interest to an environmental covenant affects the priority of that person's interest but does not by itself impose any affirmative obligation on the person with respect to the environmental covenant or affect that person's existing liability.

        - In awarding a permit for construction of a compressor station to support the transmission of natural gas through a 600-mile pipeline, the Virginia Air Pollution Control Board failed to perform its statutory duty because it did not make findings on community demographics required for assessment of the likelihood of disproportionate harm, and improperly rejected the idea of disproportionate impact on the basis that air quality standards were met.

       §
       1. That the State Corporation Commission shall conduct a formal public proceeding that will include an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of determining achievable, cost-effective energy conservation and demand response targets that can realistically be accomplished in the Commonwealth through demand-side management portfolios administered by each generating electric utility in the Commonwealth. As used in this act, 'generating electric utility' means a public service corporation that serves electric load at retail, has rates regulated by the State Corporation Commission, and that, as of January 1, 2009, directly owns and operates electric generation facilities in excess of six megawatts, other than diesel generators used for voltage control. The determination of what consumption and peak load reductions can be achieved cost-effectively shall consider standard industry-recognized tests. The Commission shall determine which test should be given greatest weight when preparing a cost-benefit analysis of a demand-side management program, taking into consideration the public interest and the potential impact on economic development in the Commonwealth.

Such report shall (i) indicate the range of consumption and peak load reductions that are potentially achievable by each generating electric utility, the range of costs that consumers would pay to achieve those reductions, and the range of financial benefits or savings that could be realized if the targets were met over a 15-year period; and (ii) determine a just and reasonable ratemaking methodology to be employed to quantify the cost responsibility of each customer class to pay for generating electric utility-administered demand-side management programs. This evaluation shall include an examination of the class cost responsibility methods used in other jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, the allocation of costs based on projected class benefits and the allocation of costs based on program participation. The analysis shall also examine other jurisdictions that permit certain nonresidential customers or classes of customers to either be exempt from paying for the utility demand-side management programs or to opt out of participating in or paying for the utility demand-side management programs, and determine if it would be in the public interest for the Commonwealth to have a similar policy.

Such plan shall also include a demonstration of financial capability to implement the plan. Financial capability may be demonstrated by the establishment of an escrow account, the creation of a trust fund to be maintained within the Department, submission of a bond, corporate guarantee based on audited financial statements, or such other instruments as the Board may deem appropriate.
    The Board may require that such plan and instruments be updated as appropriate. The Board shall give due consideration to any plan submitted by the owner in accordance with <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.010.1.html#t010.1s10.1-1410" target="_blank">§§ 10.1-1410</a></cite>,<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.010.1.html#t010.1s10.1-1428" target="_blank"> 10.1-1428</a></cite>, and<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.062.1.html#t062.1s62.1-44.15" target="_blank"> 62.1-44.15</a></cite>:1.1, in determining the necessity for and suitability of any plan submitted under this section.

       For the purposes of this section, "ceases operation" means to cease conducting the normal operation of a source which is regulated under this chapter under circumstances where it would be reasonable to expect that such operation will not be resumed by the owner at the source.

The annual fees shall be based on the actual emissions (as calculated or estimated) of each regulated pollutant, as defined in § 502 of the federal Clean Air Act, in tons per year, not to exceed 4,000 tons per year of each pollutant for each source. The annual permit program fees shall not exceed a base year amount of $25 per ton using 1990 as the base year, and shall be adjusted annually by the Consumer Price Index as described in § 502 of the federal Clean Air Act. Permit program fees for air pollution sources who receive state operating permits in lieu of Title V operating permits shall be paid in the first year and thereafter shall be paid biennially.

        - In awarding a permit for construction of a compressor station to support the transmission of natural gas through a 600-mile pipeline, the Virginia Air Pollution Control Board failed to perform its statutory duty because it did not make findings on community demographics required for assessment of the likelihood of disproportionate harm, and improperly rejected the idea of disproportionate impact on the basis that air quality standards were met.

    The Department shall issue annual notices of the fees to owners of registered sources on or before August 1 of each fiscal year.
    Each notice of a fee shall include a summary of the data on which the fee is based.
    Fees shall be payable thirty days after receipt of notice.
    Failure to make timely payment within ninety days shall be grounds to institute a collection action against the owner of the registered source by the Attorney General.

Any individual stationary source with actual emissions (as calculated or estimated) of less than 100 tons per year shall not be subject to a fee under subsection C of this section.
    Determination of the tons per year of air pollution shall be based on all actual pollutants emitted during the prior calendar year.

The regulations shall create an air emissions banking and trading program for the Commonwealth, to the extent not prohibited by federal law, that results in net air emission reductions, creates an economic incentive for reducing air emissions, and allows for continued economic growth through a program of banking and trading credits or allowances. The regulations applicable to the electric power industry shall foster competition in the electric power industry, encourage construction of clean, new generating facilities, provide without charge new source set-asides of five percent for the first five plan years and two percent per year thereafter, and provide an initial allocation period of five years. In promulgating such regulations the Board shall consider, but not be limited to, the inclusion of provisions concerning (i) the definition and use of emissions reduction credits or allowances from mobile and stationary sources, (ii) the role of offsets in emissions trading, (iii) interstate or regional emissions trading, (iv) the mechanisms needed to facilitate emissions trading and banking, and (v) the role of emissions allocations in emissions trading. No regulations shall prohibit the direct trading of air emissions credits or allowances between private industries, provided such trades do not adversely impact air quality in Virginia.

       - Acts 2008, c. 282, cl. 2, provides: "That the Air Pollution Control Board shall adopt regulations within 180 days after enactment providing that: (i) when determining whether a physical or operational change at an existing stationary source requires a permit or permit amendment under the minor new source review regulations, any change in emissions shall be calculated as the difference between the source's pre-change and postchange annual uncontrolled emission rates; and (ii) such regulations shall remain in effect until the Board changes those provisions of its minor new source regulations concerning the manner in which such change in emissions is calculated. For purposes of clause (i), the term 'uncontrolled emission rate' means the emission rate from an emissions unit when operating at maximum capacity without air pollution control equipment. Air pollution control equipment includes control equipment that is not vital to its operation, except that its use enables the owner to conform to applicable air pollution control laws and regulations. Annual uncontrolled emissions shall be based on the maximum annual rated capacity (based on 8,760 hours of operation per year) of the emissions unit, unless the emissions unit or stationary source is subject to state and federally enforceable permit conditions that limit the annual hours of operation. Enforceable permit conditions on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed may be used in determining the uncontrolled emission rate of an emissions unit or stationary source. The uncontrolled emission rate of a stationary source is the sum of the uncontrolled emission rates of the individual emissions units. Secondary emissions do not count in determining the uncontrolled emission rate of a stationary source."

         Company's composting activities constituted disposal of solid waste rather than recycling.
        </b>
        - Where no one could state with assurance how long it would take stumps to decompose into useful compost, they would lie on the surface of the land as solid waste discarded by developers, and at some future time, the stumps and other waste could become an "effective substitute for a commercial product," that expectation was too remote to exempt the composting activities from solid waste regulation in the meantime. These activities were not exempt from regulation as "recycling." Ticonderoga Farms, Inc. v. County of Loudoun, 242 Va. 170, 409 S.E.2d 446 (1991).

That it is the General Assembly's intent that the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) shall evaluate and implement measures to improve the long-term effectiveness and efficiency of its programs in ensuring the Commonwealth's air quality, water quality and land resources are protected and to ensure the maximum value from the funding provided for the Commonwealth's environmental programs. To assist DEQ in accomplishing such goals, a management efficiency peer review shall be conducted of the Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit programs and the air permit program implemented by the agency. The review shall evaluate (i) operational changes that would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations, (ii) ways to reduce the costs of compliance, and (iii) the adequacy and appropriateness of staffing levels to meet state and federal requirements. The review shall be led by a consulting firm with expertise and previous experience in conducting similar reviews of state agencies and private firms and shall include a peer review team appointed by the Director of DEQ, consisting of individuals familiar with the permit program including, but not limited to, persons nominated by the Virginia Association of Counties, the Virginia Chemistry Council, the Virginia Manufacturers Association, the Virginia Municipal League, the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission, and the Virginia Association of Municipal Wastewater Agencies. All individuals serving on the peer review team shall have previous training and experience in preparing applications for permits issued under the Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit program or the air permitting program. The consulting firm shall be selected by agreement between the Director of DEQ and the peer review team members from the previously mentioned organizations and in accordance with the Virginia Procurement Act. The review shall be completed and a written report containing findings and recommendations for the implementation of any practices, procedures or other steps necessary to increase the efficiency of DEQ shall be forwarded to the members of the peer review team by September 15, 2006. The report shall include information, to the extent available, on whether or not the recommendations would change the level of environmental protection, the estimated savings to DEQ and the regulated community, and any barriers to implementation. The report and DEQ's responses and plans for implementation of such recommendations shall be forwarded to the Chairmen of the House Committee on Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources, the House Committee on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Senate Committee on Finance by October 15, 2006.

The review shall be conducted by DEQ with the active participation of persons qualified by training and experience in the management and operation of solid waste facilities, who shall be recommended by the Virginia Waste Industries Association, the Solid Waste Association of North America and the Southwest Virginia Solid Waste Management Association. The review shall be completed and a written report containing findings and recommendations for the implementation of any practices, procedures or other steps necessary to increase the efficiency of DEQ shall be forwarded to the members of the peer review team by September 15, 2006. The report shall include information, to the extent available, on whether or not the recommendations would change the level of environmental protection, the estimated savings to DEQ and the regulated community, and any barriers to implementation.

       "a. Implement a streamlined permit application to be used for renewals of previously granted environmental permits where there has been no significant change in the permitted activity or applicable statutory or regulatory requirements during the previous permit term. Such streamlined permit renewal application shall be designed, to the extent not prohibited by federal law or regulation, to avoid the submission and duplication of information that has previously been submitted by the applicant and achieve maximum efficiency and economy for both the permittee and DEQ, and DEQ shall work with the peer review team to develop these applications with the goal of minimizing the amount of duplicate, costly work on the part of the permit renewal applicants and DEQ;

      <p>
       "b. Expeditiously implement electronic permitting, filing and reporting procedures so as to improve access to information, reduce the costs of compliance, and reduce costs to DEQ;

      <p>
       "c. Explore ways to reduce compliance costs to the permittee and reduce DEQ's oversight costs for ensuring compliance. The options to be explored shall include, but not be limited to, increased utilization of certified evaluations (i.e., by professional engineers) as a method of ensuring compliance while reducing the need for physical inspections; and

      <p>
       "d. Encourage efficient and effective environmental performance by deeming a facility's demonstration of a proven environmental management system, such as ISO 14001, along with a commitment to pollution prevention, annual progress reporting, and a record of sustained compliance as meeting the criteria for acceptance into DEQ's programs for environmental excellence.

        - While a permit may be required to move or alter a septic system, this section does not provide a private remedy. Since Virginia had no betterment statute providing a remedy for misplaced improvements, the owner had no right to maintain any portion of his septic system on his neighbor's lot, and it was not unlawful, nor did it give rise to any right of action by the owner so long as the truncation acts occurred wholly on the neighbor's lot; however, the portion of the owner's allegations intimating that the neighbor trespassed onto his property to effect the capping of the line was a viable claim.

         Constitutionality.
        </b>
        - Because the stacking provisions in this section as it read prior to its amendment in 2003, which required that containerized waste be stacked no more than two high, would have a lopsided effect on the importation of out-of-state waste and would essentially preclude the use of barges in Virginia to transport such waste, they were subject to strict scrutiny and the virtual per se rule of invalidity under the Commerce Clause. Hence, the court would grant preliminary injunction against enforcement, pending resolution on the merits. Waste Mgt. Holdings, Inc. v. Gilmore, 64 F. Supp. 2d 523 (E.D. Va. 1999).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Stacking provision unconstitutional under commerce clause.
        </b>
        - No reasonable juror could find the provisions of this section as it read prior to its amendment in 2003, banning the stacking of containers holding solid waste more than two high, had a purpose other than to reduce the flow of municipal solid waste generated outside of Virginia into Virginia for disposal. Waste Mgmt. Holdings v. Gilmore, 252 F.3d 316, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 11573 (4th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 904, 122 S. Ct. 1203, 152 L. Ed. 2d 142 (2002).

         Savings clause does not bar challenge to statute.
        </b>
        - The saving clauses stating that these provisions would be implemented only to the extent allowed by federal law did not prevent a plaintiff from challenging the stacking provision in this section as it read prior to amendment in 2003, because the language of this clause was repugnant to the straightforward, limiting language of the statutory provisions. Waste Mgmt. Holdings v. Gilmore, 252 F.3d 316, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 11573 (4th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 904, 122 S. Ct. 1203, 152 L. Ed. 2d 142 (2002).

         Negative impact on interstate commerce established.
        </b>
        - Parties asserting that the ban on stacking solid waste containers more than two containers high, in this section as it read prior to amendment in 2003, violated the Commerce Clause were only required to show how the ban, if enforced, would negatively impact interstate commerce to a greater degree than intrastate commerce, and this they had done. Waste Mgmt. Holdings v. Gilmore, 252 F.3d 316, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 11573 (4th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 904, 122 S. Ct. 1203, 152 L. Ed. 2d 142 (2002).

        </b>
        - Trial court upheld the administrative regulation adopted by the Virginia Waste Management Board of a one dollar per ton of waste fee off-loaded at facilities that receive solid and medical waste transported on state waters, as evidence in the record supported imposition of that fee.

         Standing water test invalidated.

        - Evidence in the record did not support the Virginia Waste Management Board's adoption of the regulation that prescribed a 24-inch standing water test to determine whether containers handling certain types of waste were watertight; by definition, that test did not determine whether a container, which was nine-feet high, was watertight, and a court was authorized to invalidate agency action where such action was neither supported by the record nor justified by statutory authority, as was true of the 24-inch standing water test.

      <p>
       The Commonwealth of Virginia hereby enters into and enacts into law the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact to become a party to the compact with the parties and upon the conditions named therein, which compact shall be in the form which follows and which as initially enacted in this section is as agreed to September 10, 1982.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       ARTICLE I. POLICY AND PURPOSE
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is hereby created the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact. The party states recognize and declare that each state is responsible for providing for the availability of capacity either within or outside the state for disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within its borders, except for waste generated as a result of defense activities of the federal government or federal research and development activities. They also recognize that the management of low-level radioactive waste is handled most efficiently on a regional basis. The party states further recognize that the Congress of the United States, by enacting the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act (P.L.<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.096.html#t096s96-573" target="_blank"> 96-573</a></cite>), has provided for and encouraged the development of low-level radioactive waste compacts as a tool for disposal of such wastes. The party states recognize that the safe and efficient management of low-level radioactive waste generated within the region requires that sufficient capacity to dispose of such waste be properly provided.
    <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the policy of the party states to: enter into a regional low-level radioactive waste management compact for the purpose of providing the instrument and framework for a cooperative effort, provide sufficient facilities for the proper management of low-level radioactive waste generated in the region, promote the health and safety of the region, limit the number of facilities required to effectively and efficiently manage low-level radioactive waste generated in the region, encourage the reduction of the amounts of low-level waste generated in the region, distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of successful low-level radioactive waste management equitably among the party states, and ensure the ecological management of low-level radioactive wastes.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Implicit in the Congressional consent to this compact is the expectation by the Congress and the party states that the appropriate federal agencies will actively assist the Compact Commission and the individual party states to this compact by:

       <p>
        The rights granted to the party states by this compact are additional to the rights enjoyed by sovereign states, and nothing in this compact shall be construed to infringe upon, limit or abridge those rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        a. Subject to any license issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission or a host state each party state shall have the right to have all wastes generated within its borders stored, treated, or disposed of, as applicable at regional facilities, and additionally shall have the right of access to facilities made available to the region through agreements entered into by the Commission pursuant to Article IV e. 9. The right of access by a generator within a party state to any regional facility is limited by its adherence to applicable state and federal law and regulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        b. If no operating regional facility is located within the borders of a party state and the waste generated within its borders must therefore be stored, treated, or disposed of at a regional facility in another party state, the party state without such facilities may be required by the host state or states to establish a mechanism which provides compensation for access to the regional facility according to terms and conditions established by the host state(s) and approved by a two-thirds vote of the Commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        c. Each party state shall establish the capability to regulate, license and ensure the maintenance and extended care of any facility within its borders. Host states are responsible for the availability, the subsequent post closure observation and maintenance, and the extended institutional control of their regional facilities, in accordance with the provisions of Article V, section b.
       </p>
       <p>
        d. Each party state shall establish the capability to enforce any applicable federal or state laws and regulations pertaining to the packaging and transportation of waste generated within or passing through its borders.
       </p>
       <p>
        e. Each party state shall provide to the Commission on an annual basis, any data and information necessary to the implementation of the Commission's responsibilities. Each party state shall establish the capability to obtain any data and information necessary to meet its obligation herein defined.
       </p>
       <p>
        f. Each party state shall, to the extent authorized by federal law, require generators within its borders to use the best available waste management technologies and practices to minimize the volumes of wastes requiring disposal.

       </p>
       <p>
        g.
    Subject to provisions of Article VII, h., any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a law repealing the compact, provided that if a regional facility is located within such state, such regional facility shall remain available to the region for four years after the date the Commission receives verification in writing from the governor of such party state of the rescission of the compact. The Commission, upon receipt of the notification, shall as soon as practicable provide copies of such notification to the governors, the presidents of the senates, and the speakers of the house of representatives of the party states as well as the chairman of the appropriate committees of the Congress.
       </p>
       <p>
        h.
    The right of a party state to withdraw pursuant to Article VII, g. shall terminate thirty days following the commencement of operation of the second host state disposal facility. Thereafter a party state may withdraw only with the unanimous approval of the Commission and with the consent of Congress. For purposes of this subsection, the low-level radioactive waste disposal facility located in Barnwell County, South Carolina shall be considered the first host state disposal facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        i.

      <p>
       The exercise of the powers granted by this chapter is for the benefit of the people of the Commonwealth, for the increase of their commerce and prosperity, and for the improvement of their health and living conditions. Since the operation and maintenance of projects by the Authority and the undertaking of activities in furtherance of the purpose of the Authority will constitute the performance of essential governmental functions, the Authority shall not be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon any project or any property acquired or used by the Authority under the provisions of this chapter or upon the income therefrom, including sales and use taxes on tangible personal property used in the operations of the Authority. Any bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter, their transfer and the income which may result, including any profit made on the sale, shall be free from state and local taxation. The exemption hereby granted shall not be construed to extend to persons conducting business on the premises of a facility for which local or state taxes would otherwise be required.

        - Virginia Conservation Easement Act did not create a new right to burden land by a negative easement in gross for the purpose of land conservation and historic preservation, but facilitated the continued creation of such easements by providing a clear statutory framework under which tax exemptions are made available to charitable organizations devoted to those purposes and tax benefits and incentives are provided to the grantors of such easements, contrary to the common law; moreover, the easement at issue was not of a novel character and is consistent with the statutory recognition of negative easements in gross for conservation and historic purposes.

         Conservation easement interpretation.
        </b>
        - By leaving the strict construction principle in force with the passage of the Virginia Conservation Easement Act, the legislature must have viewed this principle as an appropriate additional incentive for those who draft the conservation easements to achieve clarity in light of the fact that they are subject to enforcement in perpetuity, and this is equally true of the constitutional policy to protect the environment, the Open Space Land Act, the Virginia Outdoors Foundation, and the Virginia Land Conservation Incentives Act of 1999; like the Virginia Conservation Easement Act, none of these provisions address in any way the interpretive principles to be applied to a conservation easement.

        - Virginia Conservation Easement Act did not create a new right to burden land by a negative easement in gross for the purpose of land conservation and historic preservation, but facilitated the continued creation of such easements by providing a clear statutory framework under which tax exemptions are made available to charitable organizations devoted to those purposes and tax benefits and incentives are provided to the grantors of such easements, contrary to the common law; moreover, the easement at issue was not of a novel character and is consistent with the statutory recognition of negative easements in gross for conservation and historic purposes.

        - By leaving the strict construction principle in force with the passage of the Virginia Conservation Easement Act, the legislature must have viewed this principle as an appropriate additional incentive for those who draft the conservation easements to achieve clarity in light of the fact that they are subject to enforcement in perpetuity, and this is equally true of the constitutional policy to protect the environment, the Open Space Land Act, the Virginia Outdoors Foundation, and the Virginia Land Conservation Incentives Act of 1999; like the Virginia Conservation Easement Act, none of these provisions address in any way the interpretive principles to be applied to a conservation easement.

      <p>
       It shall be the policy of the Commonwealth, and it is the purpose of this chapter, to restore and improve the quality of state waters and to protect them from impairment and destruction for the benefit of current and future citizens of the Commonwealth. The General Assembly further determines and finds that the quality of state waters is subject to potential pollution and degradation, including excess nutrients, from both point and nonpoint source pollution and that the purposes of the State Water Control Law (<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.062.1.html#t062.1s62.1-44.2" target="_blank">§ 62.1-44.2</a></cite> et seq.) and all other laws related to the restoration, protection and improvement of the quality of state waters will be enhanced by the implementation of the provisions of this chapter. The General Assembly further determines and finds that the restoration, protection and improvement of the quality of state waters is a shared responsibility among state and local governments and individuals and to that end this chapter establishes cooperative programs related to nutrient reduction and other point and nonpoint sources of pollution.

The Fund shall consist of sums appropriated to it by the General Assembly which shall include, unless otherwise provided in the general appropriation act, 10 percent of the annual general fund revenue collections that are in excess of the official estimates in the general appropriation act and 10 percent of any unrestricted and uncommitted general fund balance at the close of each fiscal year whose reappropriation is not required in the general appropriation act. The Fund shall also consist of such other sums as may be made available to it from any other source, public or private, and shall include any penalties or damages collected under this article, federal grants solicited and received for the specific purposes of the Fund, and all interest and income from investment of the Fund. Any sums remaining in the Fund, including interest thereon, at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. All moneys designated for the Fund shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the Fund. Moneys in the Fund shall be used solely for Water Quality Improvement Grants. Expenditures and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the Comptroller upon the written request of the Director of the Department of Environmental Quality or the Director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation as provided in this chapter.

        Except as otherwise provided under this article, the purpose of the Fund is to provide Water Quality Improvement Grants to local governments, soil and water conservation districts, state agencies, institutions of higher education and individuals for point and nonpoint source pollution prevention, reduction and control programs and efforts undertaken in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The Fund shall not be used for agency operating expenses or for purposes of replacing or otherwise reducing any general, nongeneral, or special funds allocated or appropriated to any state agency; however, nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the award of a Water Quality Improvement Grant to a local government in connection with point or nonpoint pollution prevention, reduction and control programs or efforts undertaken on land owned by the Commonwealth and leased to the local government. In keeping with the purpose for which the Fund is created, it shall be the policy of the General Assembly to provide annually its share of financial support to qualifying applicants for grants in order to fulfill the Commonwealth's responsibilities under Article XI of the Constitution of Virginia.

The report shall also provide a priority list of significant state-owned properties, designated on or eligible for the Virginia Landmarks Register, which are threatened with the loss of historic integrity or functionality. In developing the report, the Department shall, in addition to significance and threat, take into account other public interest considerations associated with landmark designation and the provision of proper care and maintenance of property. These considerations shall include: (i) potential financial consequences to the Commonwealth associated with failure to care for and maintain property, (ii) significant public educational potential, (iii) significant tourism opportunities, and (iv) community values and comments. The report shall be forwarded to all affected state agencies, including institutions of higher education, the Governor, the Secretary of Administration, the Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources, the Secretary of Finance, and the General Assembly.

        The governing body of any county, city or town may, at its own expense, have erected a historical marker commemorating any person, event or place upon any public street, road or highway within its boundaries, provided that the person, event or place to be commemorated is identified with or representative of a local aspect of history. The governing body, or its duly authorized agent, shall first determine, on the basis of documented research, that the text of the marker appears to be true and correct. The local markers shall differ in style and appearance from state historical markers, and shall display, on the face of the markers, prominent notice of the governing body, or its agent, which approved the text of the marker. Design, appearance and size and height specifications for local markers shall be reviewed and approved by the Board.

        At the direction of the Director, the Comptroller of the Commonwealth is instructed and empowered to draw annual warrants upon the State Treasurer from any sums that may be provided in the general appropriation act, in favor of the treasurers of the Confederate memorial associations and chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy set forth in subsection B of this section. Such sums shall be expended by the associations and organizations for the routine maintenance of their respective Confederate cemeteries and graves and for the graves of Confederate soldiers and sailors not otherwise cared for in other cemeteries, and in erecting and caring for markers, memorials, and monuments to the memory of such soldiers and sailors. All such associations and organizations, through their proper officers, are required after July 1 of each year to submit to the Director a certified statement that the funds appropriated to the association or organization in the preceding fiscal year were or will be expended for the routine maintenance of cemeteries specified in this section and the graves of Confederate soldiers and sailors and in erecting and caring for markers, memorials and monuments to the memory of such soldiers and sailors. An association or organization failing to comply with any of the requirements of this section shall be prohibited from receiving moneys allocated under this section for all subsequent fiscal years until the association or organization fully complies with the requirements.
       </li>
       <li id="t10.1c22a01s10.1-2211ol1B">
        Allocation of appropriations made pursuant to this section shall be based on the number of graves, monuments and markers as set forth opposite the association's or organization's name, or as documented by each association or organization multiplied by the rate of $5 or the average actual cost of routine maintenance, whichever is greater, for each grave, monument or marker in the care of a Confederate memorial association or chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. For the purposes of this section the "average actual cost of care" shall be determined by the Department in a biennial survey of at least four properly maintained cemeteries, each located in a different geographical region of the Commonwealth.
       </li>
       <li id="t10.1c22a01s10.1-2211ol1C">
        In addition to funds that may be provided pursuant to subsection B, any of the Confederate memorial associations and chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy set forth in subsection B may apply to the Director for grants to perform extraordinary maintenance, renovation, repair or reconstruction of any of their respective Confederate cemeteries and graves and for the graves of Confederate soldiers and sailors. These grants shall be made from any appropriation made available by the General Assembly for such purpose. In making such grants, the Director shall give full consideration to the assistance available from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, or other agencies, except in those instances where such assistance is deemed by the Director to be detrimental to the historical, artistic or architectural significance of the site.
       </li>
       <li id="t10.1c22a01s10.1-2211ol1D">
        Local matching funds shall not be required for grants made pursuant to this section.

Such sums shall be expended by the associations for the routine maintenance of their respective Revolutionary War cemeteries and graves and for the graves of Revolutionary War soldiers and sailors not otherwise cared for in other cemeteries and in erecting and caring for markers, memorials, and monuments to the memory of such soldiers, sailors, and persons rendering service to the Patriot cause in the Revolutionary War. All such associations, through their proper officers, are required after July 1 of each year to submit to the Director a certified statement that the funds disbursed to the association or organization in the preceding fiscal year were or will be expended for the routine maintenance of cemeteries and graves specified in this section and in erecting and caring for markers, memorials, and monuments to the memory of such soldiers, sailors, and persons rendering service to the Patriot cause in the Revolutionary War. If a cemetery association fails to comply with any of the requirements of this section, such association shall be prohibited from receiving moneys allocated under this section for all subsequent fiscal years until the association fully complies with the requirements. No retroactive disbursement of funds for any preceding year shall be made. The Director shall deposit any appropriated funds that are not disbursed during the same fiscal year into the Revolutionary War Cemeteries and Graves Fund created pursuant to § 10.1-2211.1:1.

For the purposes of this section, the "average actual cost of care" shall be determined by the Department in a biennial survey of at least four properly maintained cemeteries, each located in a different geographical region of the Commonwealth.

        At the direction of the Director, the Comptroller of the Commonwealth shall draw an annual warrant upon the State Treasurer from any sum that may be provided to the Department in the general appropriation act for the purpose of maintaining qualifying cemeteries and graves pursuant to this section. Any representative of a qualified organization desiring to receive funding from such appropriation for the maintenance of qualifying cemeteries and graves pursuant to this section shall submit an application to the Department on or before May 30 each year. Such appropriations shall be allocated on the basis of the number of graves, monuments, and markers in a cemetery of African Americans who lived at any time between January 1, 1800, and January 1, 1900, the dates to be determined by reference to grave markers or, at the discretion of the Director, other historical records. Such number of graves, monuments, and markers, as documented by the qualified organization, shall be multiplied by the rate of $5 or the average actual cost of routine maintenance of a grave, monument, or marker, whichever is greater, to determine the amount of the allocation. The Department shall determine the average actual cost of routine maintenance of a grave, monument, or marker in a biennial survey of at least four properly maintained cemeteries, each located in a different geographical region of the Commonwealth. The Director shall deposit any appropriated funds that are not disbursed during the same fiscal year into the Fund.

        Each qualified organization, through its proper officer, shall after July 1 of each year submit to the Director a certified statement that the funds appropriated to the organization during the preceding fiscal year were or will be expended for the purposes set forth in subsection D. No organization that fails to comply with any of the requirements of this section shall receive moneys allocated under this section for any subsequent fiscal year until the organization fully complies with the requirements.

        In addition to funds that may be provided pursuant to subsection B or C, any organization that receives funds pursuant to subsection B or C may apply to the Director for a grant to perform extraordinary maintenance, renovation, repair, or reconstruction of any of its historical African American cemeteries and graves. Such a grant shall be made from any appropriation made available by the General Assembly for such purpose or from the Fund.

       <li id="t10.1c22a01s10.1-2211.2ol1G">
        Any locality may receive and hold funds drawn pursuant to subsection B or C on behalf of any qualified organization until such time as the organization is able to receive or utilize such funds. No local matching funds shall be required for any grants made pursuant to this section.
