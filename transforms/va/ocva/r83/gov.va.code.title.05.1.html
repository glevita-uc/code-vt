        Transition provisions.
       </b>
       - At its regular session of 1964 the General Assembly directed the Virginia Code Commission to revise certain titles of the Code, including Title 5, relating to aviation, and in July, 1965, the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing the proposed revision of Title 5, which was published as House Document 2 of the 1966 session. The Code Commission's draft of the revision, as amended by the General Assembly, became chapter 576 of the Acts of 1966. Effective July 1, 1966, it repealed Title 5 and enacted in lieu thereof a new Title 5.1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of Title 5.

      </p>
      <p>
       "3. All acts and parts of acts, all sections of the Code of Virginia, and all provisions of municipal charters inconsistent with the provisions of this act are, except as otherwise provided, repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.
      </p>
      <p>
       "4. The repeal of Title 5 effective as of July 1, 1966, shall not affect any act or offense done or committed, or any penalty or forfeiture incurred, or any right established, accrued or accruing on or before such date, or any prosecution, suit or action pending on that date. Except as in this act otherwise provided, neither the repeal of Title 5 of the Code of Virginia nor the enactment of Title 5.1 shall apply to offenses committed prior to July 1, 1966, and prosecutions for such offenses shall be governed by the prior law, which is continued in effect for that purpose. For the purposes of this act, an offense was committed prior to July 1, 1966 if any of the essential elements of the offense occurred prior thereto.
      </p>
      <p>
       "5. Whenever in Title 5.1 any of the conditions, requirements, provisions or contents of any section, article or chapter of Title 5, as such title existed prior to July 1, 1966, are transferred in the same or in modified form to a new section, article or chapter of Title 5.1, and whenever any such former section, article or chapter of Title 5 is given a new number in Title 5.1, all references to any such former section, article or chapter of Title 5 appearing elsewhere in the Code of Virginia than in Title 5.1 shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section, article or chapter containing such conditions, requirements, provisions or contents or portions thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       "6. It is the intention of the General Assembly that this act shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes set out herein, and if any clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this act shall ever be declared unconstitutional, it shall be deemed severable, and the remainder of this act shall continue in full force and effect."
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 717 of the Acts of 1966 provides: "Whenever, during the regular session of the General Assembly of Virginia of nineteen hundred sixty-six there shall have been enacted any statute purporting to revise, rearrange, amend and recodify any title of the Code of Virginia, such statute shall be deemed to have been enacted prior in time to any other statute enacted at such session adding to, repealing or amending and reenacting any portion of such title; and every such other statute shall be deemed to have so added to, repealed or amended and reenacted, as the case may be, such title as so revised, rearranged, amended and recodified; provided, however, that effect shall be given to any such other, or subsequent, statute only to the extent of any apparent changes in the law as it existed prior to such session."

Such member shall have the powers and duties of other members of the Board only with respect to the airport or airports so acquired.
      </p>
      <p>
       C.
    There may be a member of the Board from any county or city wherein the Board acquires or constructs an airport, to be elected by the governing body of the county or city and to serve at its pleasure. Such member shall have the powers and duties of other members of the Board only with respect to such airport. If the Board acquires an airport which was constructed by one political subdivision but is located in another, the political subdivision which constructed the airport, rather than the political subdivision in which it is located, shall be represented on the Board.

       The Board is hereby authorized to provide for the issuance, at one time or from time to time, of revenue bonds of the Board for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any one or more airport projects or of any portion or portions thereof. The principal of and the interest on such bonds shall be payable solely from the funds provided in this chapter for such payment. Any bonds of the Board issued pursuant to this chapter shall not constitute a debt of the Commonwealth, or any political subdivision thereof other than the Board, and shall so state on their face. Neither the commissioners of the Board nor any person executing such bonds shall be liable personally thereon by reason of the issuance thereof. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the Board, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the Board, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Board, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board prior to the issuance of the bonds. The Board shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form or both, as the Board may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The Board may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the airport project or projects for which such bonds shall have been issued, and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the Board may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds, or may be applied to the payment of the cost of any additional airport project or projects.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Board may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Board may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this chapter without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau or agency of the Commonwealth, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this chapter.

        <br/>
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       In the discretion of the Board any bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the Board and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth. Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage any airport project or any part thereof. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Board in relation to the acquisition of property and the acquisition, construction, establishment, improvement, extension, enlargement, equipment, maintenance, repair, operation, and insurance of the airport project or projects in connection with which such bonds shall have been authorized, the rates and fees to be charged, the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, and conditions or limitations with respect to the issuance of additional bonds. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth which may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Board. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the Board may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the airport project or projects.

      <p>
       The Board is hereby authorized to fix, revise, charge, and collect rates, fees, and other charges for the use of or for the services and facilities furnished by each airport project and the different parts thereof, and to contract with any person, partnership, association, or corporation desiring the use of any part thereof, and to fix the terms, conditions, rents and rates of charges for such use. Such rates, fees, and other charges shall be so fixed and adjusted that revenues of the Board, together with any other available funds, will be sufficient at all times to pay (i) the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating such airport project or projects, and (ii) the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due and payable, and to create reserves for such purposes. Such rates, fees and other charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any other commission, board, bureau or agency of the Commonwealth. The revenues derived from the airport project or projects in connection with which the bonds shall have been issued, except such part thereof as may be necessary to pay such cost of maintenance, repair, and operation and to provide such reserves therefor as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement in a sinking fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, the revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the Board shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind against the Board, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the Board. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement, such sinking fund shall be a fund for all such bonds without distinction or priority of one over another.

       All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this chapter, whether as proceeds from the sale of bonds or as revenues, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this chapter. The resolution authorizing the bonds of any issue or the trust agreement securing such bonds shall provide that any officer with whom, or any bank or trust company with which, such moneys shall be deposited shall act as trustee of such moneys and shall hold and apply the same for the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this chapter and such resolution or trust agreement may provide. In the case of revenues or the proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, the trustee may invest and reinvest such funds in securities that are legal investments under the laws of the Commonwealth for funds held by fiduciaries pending their need for the construction of the projects. In the case of the proceeds of the sale of refunding bonds, the trustee may invest and reinvest such funds in direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and the interest on which are guaranteed by, the United States of America. Such money and the interest, income and profits, if any, earned on such investment shall be available for the payment of all or any part of the principal, interest and redemption premium, if any, of the bonds being refunded. The proceeds of the sale of refunding bonds shall be so invested and applied as to ensure that the principal, interest and redemption premium, if any, on the bonds being refunded shall be paid in full on their respective maturity, redemption or interest payment dates. After the terms of the trust have been fully satisfied, any balance of such proceeds, interest, income and profits, if any, realized on the investments thereof may be returned to the Board for use by it in any lawful manner.

In case of disagreement as to the value of the property, an appeal shall lie to the circuit court of the jurisdiction in which the airport or facility is located which court shall determine the value of such property and the ratio of assessed to true values of property in such political subdivision.

The Department shall furnish any necessary forms pursuant to the issuance of such registration and may assess a fee for such issuance not in excess of $5 annually. The Department may, in lieu of issuing aircraft registration required by subsection A, issue commercial aircraft registration to air carriers and commercial dealers and issue to noncommercial dealers noncommercial dealer fleet registration, to cover all aircraft owned by such dealers and all aircraft for sale held by dealers on a consignment basis from an aircraft manufacturer. The Department may assess a fee not in excess of $50 annually for any such noncommercial dealer fleet registrations issued and a fee not in excess of $100 annually for any such commercial fleet registrations issued.

      <p>
       Except as provided in <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.1973.html#t1973c1973-1974" target="_self">§ 5.1-7.2</a></cite>, every person, before operating an airport or landing area or adding or extending a runway, shall first secure from the Department a license. The application therefor shall be made on the form prescribed and furnished by the Department and shall be accompanied by a fee not exceeding $100.
    <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Such license shall be issued for a period not to exceed seven years and shall be renewed every seven years. Before issuing such license, the Department shall require the holder of such license to furnish proof of financial responsibility prescribed in Chapter 8.2 (<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.1973.html#t1973c1973-1974" target="_self">§ 5.1-88.7</a></cite> et seq.).
    <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       It shall be unlawful for any person to operate any airport or landing area which is open to the general public for the landing or departure of any aircraft until a license therefor shall be issued by the Department.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Before issuing such license for the establishment of a new airport, the Department shall investigate the location of such airport or landing area with the relation to its proximity to and its runway orientation in relation to any other airport or landing area and shall provide for the safety of civil aircraft alighting thereon or departing therefrom. If the proposed airport or landing area shall be so situated as to endanger aircraft using the same or any other airport or landing area in close proximity, and if proper provisions have not been made in all other respects for the safety of aircraft alighting thereon or departing therefrom, the license shall not be granted. To be licensed, an airport required to be licensed under <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.1973.html#t1973c1973-1974" target="_self">§ 5.1-7.2</a></cite> must meet this criterion and any applicable requirement provided for in regulation promulgated under this section, but no others.
    <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board may, by regulation, adopt any other requirements for licensure that are related to the safety of civil aircraft using such airport or landing area. Any airport having a license issued prior to October 1, 1995, and not meeting one or more minimum standards as defined in Part III (24 VAC<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.05.html#t05c5-20" target="_blank"> 5-20</a></cite>-120 et seq.) of the Virginia Aviation Regulations, shall be exempt from having to comply with those noncomplying standards for as long as the airport remains an active public-use facility unless those noncomplying standards are caused by natural growth. Should such airport cease to be open to the public for one year, and subsequently reopen, it shall be required to comply with all applicable minimum standards for licensure.
    <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to the above safety requirements, before a license is initially issued, the Department shall consider the reviews and comments of appropriate state agencies coordinated by the Department of Environmental Quality, and shall cause a public hearing to be held concerning the economic, social and environmental effects of the location or runway orientation of the airport or landing area if the facility is listed in the Virginia Air Transportation System Plan; however, such coordinated review by the Department of Environmental Quality shall not exceed 90 days after the Department has requested review by the Department of Environmental Quality. The public hearing required by this section shall be conducted by the Department of Environmental Quality in the jurisdiction in which the airport or landing area is located, after publication of notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in such jurisdiction at least 10 days in advance of such hearing.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Any license issued shall describe the number of runways, the length and orientation of each runway and/or, if appropriate, the landing area.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If a runway is to be extended or new runways are to be added, a revised license shall be applied for from the Department. If the airport or landing area is listed in the Virginia Air Transportation System Plan, the Department shall consider the reviews and comments of appropriate state agencies, coordinated by the Department of Environmental Quality, and shall cause a public hearing to be held concerning the economic, social and environmental effects of such changes to the license.
       <br/>

       If an airport or landing area cannot meet the requirements for licensure that have been adopted by the Virginia Aviation Board, or having met those requirements cannot maintain compliance, the Department may issue conditional licenses to allow time for the airport or landing areas to take steps to meet those requirements or may revoke any license issued, if requirements for licensure are not met or cannot be met.

       All airports or landing areas that hold licenses or permits shall be issued new licenses, without charge, on or before October 1, 1995, describing the number, length and orientation of the runway or runways or, if appropriate, the landing area, which shall be valid for up to seven years. The length of the new license term may be staggered so that all licenses will not become renewable at the same time. If any airport landing area does not meet the current requirements for licensure, a new license may be issued.

     Authority to operate airport.
    </b>
    - The Louisa Industrial Development Authority (IDA) presently lacks legal authority to operate an airport. Contracting out certain airport operations does not change the fact that the IDA is the airport operator, nor does the certification of the IDA's attorney that the IDA has authority to conduct certain airport activities create that authority where it does not exist under applicable law. The Board of Supervisors may limit the number and type of projects undertaken by the IDA, but the Board may not limit the debt incurred by the IDA on a particular project.

      </p>
      <p>
       C.
    Any landowner who gives permission, express or implied, to another person to operate aircraft or ultralight vehicles of any type for the personal use of such person or for the use of an easement as set forth in subsection B does not thereby:
      </p>
      <p>

       A.
    No registration or permit shall be issued by the Department to any contract carrier by aircraft until and after such contract carrier has filed with the Department an insurance policy, a bond underwritten by an insurer, or certificate of insurance in lieu thereof, which certificate shall certify that such policy or bond covers the liability of such contract carrier in accordance with the provisions of this statute.

       2. Create and maintain a special fund or funds for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the loan from the Fund to the local government and any other amounts becoming due under any agreement entered into in connection with the loan, or for the operation, maintenance, repair, or replacement of the project or any portions thereof or other property of the local government, and deposit into any fund or funds amounts sufficient to make any payments on the loan as they become due and payable.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Create and maintain other special funds as required by the Authority.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       b. The combination of one or more projects, or the combination of one or more projects with one or more other undertakings, facilities, utilities, or systems, for the purpose of operations and financing, and the pledging of the revenues from such combined projects, undertakings, facilities, utilities, and systems to secure the loan from the Fund to the local government made in connection with such combination or any part or parts thereof;
      </p>
      <p>
       c. The maintenance, replacement, renewal, and repair of the project; and
      </p>
      <p>

         Court must defer to city's rational decision on airport requirements.
        </b>
        - If the city has decided rationally that minimum space requirements for aviation fuel vendors serve its legitimate interest in maintaining the airport, the court must defer to that decision. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court was bound to accept the municipal defendants' argument that the overbreadth of their aviation fuel standards was attributable to the high degree of danger associated with air travel. It was rational for the city to err on the side of caution by promulgating broad minimum requirements for its airport contractors. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Under rational basis analysis.
        </b>
        - Plaintiff's contention that city's aviation fuel standards were more restrictive than safety and efficiency require was insufficient to allow the court to scrutinize the airport regulations more strictly than under a rational basis analysis. Although it is true that legislation involving fundamental rights or suspect classifications must further its purpose in the least restrictive manner, economic legislation can accomplish its goal in broad strokes. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where municipal defendants sufficiently demonstrated that their standards for aviation fuel vendors at the airport were rationally related to the legitimate interest to safely and efficiently provide public aviation services, plaintiff's complaint failed to demonstrate that the municipal defendants violated its right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).

         Free market for aviation businesses limited by legislature.
        </b>
        - By granting cities the power to regulate airport facilities "on such terms and subject to such conditions and regulations as may be provided," the Virginia legislature limited the free market for aviation businesses. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).

        <b>
         Express endorsement of anticompetitive results not necessary.
        </b>
        - Unlike the aviation laws of other states, the Virginia law does not expressly anticipate exclusive or anticompetitive arrangements. Nonetheless, a legislature's express endorsement of anticompetitive behavior is unnecessary for a municipality's immunity under the antitrust laws. Indeed, the state action doctrine realistically anticipates that anticompetitive results are often foreseeable when a political subdivision implements a state grant of general authority to act efficiently and in the best public interest. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).

     Authority to operate airport.
    </b>
    - The Louisa Industrial Development Authority (IDA) presently lacks legal authority to operate an airport. Contracting out certain airport operations does not change the fact that the IDA is the airport operator, nor does the certification of the IDA's attorney that the IDA has authority to conduct certain airport activities create that authority where it does not exist under applicable law. The Board of Supervisors may limit the number and type of projects undertaken by the IDA, but the Board may not limit the debt incurred by the IDA on a particular project.

         Court must defer to city's rational decision on airport requirements.
        </b>
        - If the city has decided rationally that minimum space requirements for aviation fuel vendors serve its legitimate interest in maintaining the airport, the court must defer to that decision. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court was bound to accept the municipal defendants' argument that the overbreadth of their aviation fuel standards was attributable to the high degree of danger associated with air travel. It was rational for the city to err on the side of caution by promulgating broad minimum requirements for its airport contractors. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).

        <b>
         Under rational basis analysis.
        </b>
        - Plaintiff's contention that city's aviation fuel standards were more restrictive than safety and efficiency require was insufficient to allow the court to scrutinize the airport regulations more strictly than under a rational basis analysis. Although it is true that legislation involving fundamental rights or suspect classifications must further its purpose in the least restrictive manner, economic legislation can accomplish its goal in broad strokes. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where municipal defendants sufficiently demonstrated that their standards for aviation fuel vendors at the airport were rationally related to the legitimate interest to safely and efficiently provide public aviation services, plaintiff's complaint failed to demonstrate that the municipal defendants have violated its right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).

         Free market for aviation businesses limited by legislature.
        </b>
        - By granting cities the power to regulate airport facilities "on such terms and subject to such conditions and regulations as may be provided," the Virginia legislature limited the free market for aviation businesses. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).

         Express endorsement of anticompetitive results not necessary.
        </b>
        - Unlike the aviation laws of other states, the Virginia law does not expressly anticipate exclusive or anticompetitive arrangements. Nonetheless, a legislature's express endorsement of anticompetitive behavior is unnecessary for a municipality's immunity under the antitrust laws. Indeed, the state action doctrine realistically anticipates that anticompetitive results are often foreseeable when a political subdivision implements a state grant of general authority to act efficiently and in the best public interest. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).

         Court must defer to city's rational decision on airport requirements.
        </b>
        - If the city has decided rationally that minimum space requirements for aviation fuel vendors serve its legitimate interest in maintaining the airport, the court must defer to that decision. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court was bound to accept the municipal defendants' argument that the overbreadth of their aviation fuel standards was attributable to the high degree of danger associated with air travel. It was rational for the city to err on the side of caution by promulgating broad minimum requirements for its airport contractors. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).

         Under rational basis analysis.
        </b>
        - Plaintiff's contention that city's aviation fuel standards were more restrictive than safety and efficiency require was insufficient to allow the court to scrutinize the airport regulations more strictly than under a rational basis analysis. Although it is true that legislation involving fundamental rights or suspect classifications must further its purpose in the least restrictive manner, economic legislation can accomplish its goal in broad strokes. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).

         Free market for aviation businesses limited by legislature.
        </b>
        - By granting cities the power to regulate airport facilities "on such terms and subject to such conditions and regulations as may be provided," the Virginia legislature limited the free market for aviation businesses. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where municipal defendants sufficiently demonstrated that their standards for aviation fuel vendors at the airport were rationally related to the legitimate interest to safely and efficiently provide public aviation services, plaintiff's complaint failed to demonstrate that the municipal defendants have violated its right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).

         Express endorsement of anticompetitive results not necessary.
        </b>
        - Unlike the aviation laws of other states, the Virginia law does not expressly anticipate exclusive or anticompetitive arrangements. Nonetheless, a legislature's express endorsement of anticompetitive behavior is unnecessary for a municipality's immunity under the antitrust laws. Indeed, the state action doctrine realistically anticipates that anticompetitive results are often foreseeable when a political subdivision implements a state grant of general authority to act efficiently and in the best public interest. Hillman Flying Serv., Inc. v. City of Roanoke, 652 F. Supp. 1142 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd, 846 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1988).

     Authority to operate airport.
    </b>
    - The Louisa Industrial Development Authority (IDA) presently lacks legal authority to operate an airport. Contracting out certain airport operations does not change the fact that the IDA is the airport operator, nor does the certification of the IDA's attorney that the IDA has authority to conduct certain airport activities create that authority where it does not exist under applicable law. The Board of Supervisors may limit the number and type of projects undertaken by the IDA, but the Board may not limit the debt incurred by the IDA on a particular project.

      <p>
       In order to further the interests of national security, the Commonwealth Transportation Board may, at the request of the Army and Navy Departments, Federal Highway Administration or other agency of the United States, construct and maintain, or cooperate with any such federal agency in the construction and maintenance of flight strips, airfields, and roads leading thereto from public highways. To carry out this purpose the Department, acting through the Commissioner of Highways may acquire in the name of the Commonwealth by gift or purchase or by the exercise of the power of eminent domain such real property, or interest therein, including the rights in the air above real property, as may be needed for such flight strips, airfields and roads. The exercise of the power of eminent domain hereby conferred shall be in the same manner and pursuant to the same procedure that is now, or may hereafter be, provided by law for the acquisition of real property by the Commissioner of Highways for highway purposes, and in order that the construction work may proceed without delay, the Department may, in the same manner and under the same conditions and procedure as is provided in the case of real property needed for highway purposes, enter upon and take possession of such real property as may be needed for the purposes of this section, and proceed with the construction work prior to the acquisition of title to the property in condemnation proceedings. In carrying out the purposes of this section, the Department may expend only such funds as may be provided for such purposes by the federal government.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If requested to do so by the federal agency which provided the funds with which the Department acquired the property for any such flight strips, airfields or roads, the Department may authorize and direct the Commissioner of Highways to convey, by deed executed in the name of the Commonwealth, such property to the United States to be used in the interests of national security. If title to such property is retained by the Commonwealth, the Department may authorize any agency of the United States to use such property to further the interest of national security. Whenever the Department finds that property heretofore or hereafter acquired by it for any such flight strips, airfields or roads is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was acquired, it may sell the same for such consideration as it deems adequate to any private person, firm or corporation and may authorize and direct the Commissioner of Highways to execute a deed in the name of the Commonwealth conveying such property to the purchaser. The proceeds from any such sale shall be paid into the treasury of Virginia to the credit of the highway fund unless the terms of any grant to the Department or the Commonwealth provide otherwise, in which case such proceeds shall be disposed of in accordance with the terms of such grant.

In cases where the joint rate, fare, or charge was established pursuant to a finding or order of the Commission and the divisions thereof are found by it to have been unjust, unreasonable, or inequitable, or unduly preferential or prejudicial, the Commission may also by order determine what would have been the just, reasonable, and equitable divisions thereof to be received by the several carriers, and require adjustment to be made in accordance therewith. The order of the Commission may require the adjustment of divisions between the carriers, in accordance with the order, from the date of filing the complaint or entry of order of investigation or such other date subsequent as the Commission finds justified and, in the case of joint rates prescribed by the Commission, the order as to divisions may be made effective as a part of the original order.

       The Authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance, at one time or from time to time, of revenue bonds of the Authority for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of Authority Facilities, including the refunding of federal appropriations not reimbursed to the United States Treasury by the Metropolitan Washington Airports. The principal of and the interest on such bonds shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the Authority, and may be subject to redemption or repurchase before maturity, at the option of the Authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The bonds may bear interest payable at such time or times and at such rate or rates as determined by the Authority or as determined in such manner as the Authority may provide, including the determination by agents designated by the Authority under guidelines established by it. The Authority shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth of Virginia. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act or any recitals in any bonds issued under the provisions of this section, all such bonds shall be deemed to be negotiable instruments under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or negotiated sale, and for such price, as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this section.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The proceeds of the bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of Authority Facilities, including improvements, and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the Authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this section without obtaining the consent of any agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and without any other proceedings, conditions or things not specifically required by this section.

       In the discretion of the Authority, any bonds issued under the provisions of this act may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the power of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth of Virginia. Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the fees and other revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage the airports or any part thereof. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of the airports, the rates or fees or other charges to be charged, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia which may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the airports.

       The Authority is hereby authorized to fix, revise, charge and collect fees or other charges for the use of the airports and to contract with any person, partnership, association or corporation desiring the use of any part thereof, including the right-of-way adjoining the airports for placing thereon telephone, telegraph, electric light or power lines, and to fix the terms, conditions, rents and fees or other charges for such use. Such fees or other charges shall be so fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of fees or other charges from the airports as to provide a fund sufficient with other revenues, if any, (i) to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the airports, (ii) to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds as the same shall become due and payable, and (iii) to create reserves for such purposes. The fees and other charges and all other revenues derived from the airports, except such part thereof as may be necessary to pay such cost of maintenance, repair and operation and provide such reserves as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement in a sinking fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The fees and other charges and other revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the Authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the Authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the Authority. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement, such sinking fund shall be a fund for all such bonds without distinction or priority of one over another.
