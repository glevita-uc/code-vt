       Policy and Purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       The party states recognize that the proper employment and conservation of energy and employment of energy-related facilities, materials, and products, within the context of a responsible regard for the environment can assist substantially in the industrialization of the South and the development of a balanced economy for the region. They also recognize that optimum benefit from the acquisition of energy resources and facilities require systematic encouragement, guidance, and assistance from the party states on a cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis; it is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort to improve the economy of the South and contribute to the individual and community well-being of the region's people.

The independence of each state and the special needs of subregions are recognized and are to be safeguarded. Accordingly, the cooperation resulting from this agreement is intended to assist the states in meeting their own problems by enhancing their abilities to recognize and analyze regional opportunities and take account of regional influences in planning and implementing their public policies.

      <p>
       B. The Board shall consist of five members from each party state, as follows:

       1. The governor.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       A. The Board shall prepare and keep current a Statement of Regional Objectives, including recommended approaches to regional problems. The Statement may also identify projects deemed by the Board to be of regional significance. The Statement shall be available in its initial form two years from the effective date of this agreement and shall be amended or revised no less frequently than once every six years. The Statement shall be in such detail as the Board may prescribe. Amendments, revisions, supplements or evaluations may be transmitted at any time. An annual commentary on the Statement shall be submitted at a regular time to be determined by the Board.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. In addition to powers conferred on the Board elsewhere in this agreement, the Board shall have the power to make or commission studies, investigations and recommendations with respect to:
      </p>
      <p>
       1. The planning and programming of projects of interstate or regional significance.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Planning and scheduling of governmental services and programs which would be of assistance to the orderly growth and prosperity of the region, and to the well-being of its population.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Effective utilization of such federal assistance as may be available on a regional basis or as may have an interstate or regional impact.

       Article IV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Avoidance of Duplication.
      </p>
      <p>
       A. To avoid duplication of effort and in the interest of economy, the Board shall make use of existing studies, surveys, plans and data and other materials in the possession of the governmental agencies of the party states and their respective subdivisions or in the possession of other interstate agencies. Each such agency, within available appropriations and if not expressly prevented or limited by law, is hereby authorized to make such materials available to the Board and to otherwise assist it in the performance of its functions. At the request of the Board, each such agency is further authorized to provide information regarding plans and programs affecting the region, or any subarea thereof, so that the Board may have available to it current information with respect thereto.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. The Board shall use qualified public and private agencies to make investigations and conduct research, but if it is unable to secure the undertaking of such investigations or original research by a qualified public or private agency, it shall have the power to make its own investigations and conduct its own research. The Board may make contracts with any public or private agencies or private persons or entities for the undertaking of such investigations or original research within its purview.
      </p>
      <p>
       C. In general, the policy of paragraph B shall apply to the activities of the Board relating to its Statement of Regional Objectives, but nothing herein shall be construed to require the Board to rely on the services of other persons or agencies in developing the Statement of Regional Objectives or any amendment, supplement or revision thereof.

       Article V.

      <p>
       Advisory Committees.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board shall establish a Local Governments Advisory Committee. In addition, the Board may establish advisory committees representative of subregions of the South, civic and community interests, industry, agriculture, labor or other categories or any combinations thereof. Unless the laws of a party state contain a contrary requirement, any public official of the party state or a subdivision thereof may serve on an advisory committee established pursuant hereto and such service may be considered as a duty of his regular office or employment.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Article VI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Internal Management of the Board.
      </p>
      <p>
       A. The members of the Board shall be entitled to one vote each. No action of the Board shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the Board are cast in favor thereof. Action of the Board shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the members or their alternates are present. The Board shall meet at least once a year. In its bylaws, and subject to such directions and limitations as may be contained therein, the Board may delegate the exercise of any of its powers relating to internal administration and management to an Executive Committee or the Executive Director. In no event shall any such delegation include final approval of:
      </p>
      <p>
       1. A budget or appropriation request.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. The Statement of Regional Objectives or any amendment, supplement or revision thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Official comments on or recommendations with respect to projects of interstate or regional significance.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. The annual report.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. To assist in the expeditious conduct of its business when the full Board is not meeting, the Board shall elect an Executive Committee of not to exceed seventeen members, including at least one member from each party state. The Executive Committee, subject to the provisions of this agreement and consistent with the policies of the Board, shall be constituted and function as provided in the bylaws of the Board. One-half of the membership of the Executive Committee shall consist of governors, and the remainder shall consist of other members of the Board, except that at any time when there is an odd number of members on the Executive Committee, the number of governors shall be one less than half of the total membership. The members of the Executive Committee shall serve for terms of two years, except that members elected to the first Executive Committee shall be elected as follows: one less than half of the membership for two years and the remainder for one year. The Chairman, Chairman-Elect, Vice-Chairman and Treasurer of the Board shall be members of the Executive Committee and anything in this paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding shall serve during their continuance in these offices. Vacancies in the Executive Committee shall not affect its authority to act, but the Board at its next regularly ensuing meeting following the occurrence of any vacancy shall fill it for the unexpired term.
      </p>
      <p>
       C. The Board shall have a seal.
      </p>
      <p>
       D. The Board shall elect, from among its members, a Chairman, a Chairman-Elect, a Vice-Chairman and a Treasurer. Elections shall be annual. The Chairman-Elect shall succeed to the office of Chairman for the year following his service as Chairman-Elect. For purposes of the election and service of officers of the Board, the year shall be deemed to commence at the conclusion of the annual meeting of the Board and terminate at the conclusion of the next annual meeting thereof. The Board shall provide for the appointment of an Executive Director. Such Executive Director shall serve at the pleasure of the Board, and together with the Treasurer and such other personnel as the Board may deem appropriate shall be bonded in such amounts as the Board shall determine. The Executive Director shall be Secretary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article VII.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finance.
      </p>
      <p>
       A. The Board shall advise the governor or designated officer or officers of each party state of its budget of estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state. Each of the Board's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. The total amount of appropriation requests under any budget shall be apportioned among the party states. Such apportionment shall be in accordance with the following formula:
      </p>
      <p>
       In implementing this formula, the Board shall employ the most recent authoritative sources of information and shall specify the sources used.
      </p>
      <p>
       C. The Board shall not pledge the credit of any party state. The Board may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it pursuant to Article VI (h) of this agreement, provided that the Board takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring an obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the Board makes use of funds available to it pursuant to Article VI H, or borrows pursuant to this paragraph, the Board shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same. The Board may borrow against anticipated revenues for terms not to exceed two years, but in any such event the credit pledged shall be that of the Board and not a party state.
      </p>
      <p>
       D. The Board shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Board shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established by its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Board shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Board.
      </p>
      <p>
       E. The accounts of the Board shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the Board.
      </p>
      <p>
       F. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent Board compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the Board.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Article VIII.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cooperation with the Federal Government and Other Governmental Entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each party state is hereby authorized to participate in cooperative or joint planning undertakings with the federal government, and any appropriate agency or agencies thereof, or with any interstate agency or agencies. Such participation shall be at the instance of the governor or in such manner as state law may provide or authorize. The Board may facilitate the work of state representatives in any joint interstate or cooperative federal-state undertaking authorized by this article, and each such state shall keep the Board advised of its activities in respect of such undertakings, to the extent that they have interstate or regional significance.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Article IX.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subregional Activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board may undertake studies or investigations centering on the problems of one or more selected subareas within the region; provided that in its judgment, such studies or investigations will have value as demonstrations for similar or other areas within the region. If a study or investigation that would be of primary benefit to a given state, unit of local government, or intrastate or interstate area is proposed, and if the Board finds that it is not justified in undertaking the work for its regional value as a demonstration, the Board may undertake the study or investigation as a special project. In any such event, it shall be a condition precedent that satisfactory financing and personnel arrangements be concluded to assure that the party or parties benefited bear all costs which the Board determines that it would be inequitable for it to assume. Prior to undertaking any study or investigation pursuant to this article as a special project, the Board shall make reasonable efforts to secure the undertaking of the work by another responsible public or private entity in accordance with the policy set forth in Article IV B.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Article X.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comprehensive Land Use Planning.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any two or more contiguous party states desire to prepare a single or consolidated comprehensive land use plan, or a land use plan for any interstate area lying partly within each such state, the governors of the states involved may designate the Board as their joint agency for the purpose. The Board shall accept such designation and carry out such responsibility; provided that the states involved make arrangements satisfactory to the Board to reimburse it or otherwise provide the resources with which the land use plan is to be prepared. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to deny the availability for use in the preparation of any such plan of data and information already in the possession of the Board or to require payment on account of the use thereof in addition to payments otherwise required to be made pursuant to other provisions of this agreement.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Article XI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compacts and Agencies Unaffected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to:
      </p>
      <p>
       1. Affect the powers or jurisdiction of any agency of a party state or any subdivision thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Affect the rights or obligations of any governmental units, agencies or officials, or of any private persons or entities conferred or imposed by any interstate or interstate-federal compacts to which any one or more states participating herein are parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Impinge on the jurisdiction of any existing interstate-federal mechanism for regional planning or development.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Article XII.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eligible Parties; Entry Into and Withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
       A. This agreement shall have as eligible parties the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Territory of the Virgin Islands, hereinafter referred to as party states.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. Any eligible state may enter into this agreement and it shall become binding thereon when it has adopted the same; provided that in order to enter into initial effect, adoption by at least five states shall be required.
      </p>
      <p>
       C. Adoption of the agreement may be either by enactment thereof or by adherence thereto by the governor; provided that in the absence of enactment, adherence by the governor shall be sufficient to make his state a party only until December 31, 1973. During any period when a state is participating in this agreement through gubernatorial action, the governor may provide to the Board an equitable share of the financial support of the Board from any source available to him. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a governor to take action contrary to the constitution or laws of his state.
      </p>
      <p>
       D. Except for a withdrawal effective on December 31, 1973, in accordance with paragraph C of this article, any party state may withdraw from this agreement by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Article XIII.
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction and Severability.
      </p>
      <p>
       This agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States, or the application thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

       CHESAPEAKE REGIONAL OLYMPIC GAMES COMPACT.
      </p>

      <p>
       Purpose and Findings.
      </p>
      <ol type="A">
       <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1A">
        The purpose of this compact shall be to create a regional authority to oversee the conduct of the 2012 Olympic Games, coordinated and managed by the local Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG), and to assure that the region's guarantees and commitments accepted in conjunction with hosting the Olympic Games are fulfilled.
       </li>
       <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B">
        The General Assembly finds that:
        <ol>
         <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B1">
          For some time, the State of Maryland (including the City of Baltimore), the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Virginia, through the nonprofit organization known as the Washington/Baltimore Regional 2012 Coalition (WBRC 2012), have been actively engaged in national competition to win the U.S. Candidate City designation and, subsequently, the Host City designation and the right to host the 2012 Olympic Games.
         </li>
         <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B2">
          Hosting the Olympic Games will provide several major, lasting, and unique benefits for all of the citizens of the Chesapeake region, including:
          <ol type="a">
           <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B2a">
            Direct, positive economic impact on our regional economy;
           </li>
           <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B2b">
            An opportunity to showcase our region to the world;
           </li>
           <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B2c">
            A catalyst for regional action; and
           </li>
           <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B2d">
            A renewed sense of pride along with a tangible legacy (e.g. new and improved venues and enhanced transportation infrastructure).
           </li>
          </ol>
         </li>
         <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B3">
          Independent economic studies show that preparing for and hosting the Olympic Games will have a positive economic impact on the region, including:
          <ol type="a">
           <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B3a">
            Direct and indirect spending in excess of $5,000,000,000;
           </li>
           <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B3b">
            The creation of approximately 70,000 jobs;
           </li>
           <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B3c">
            Increased tax revenues resulting from Olympic-related economic activity in excess of $130,000,000, without raising or creating any new taxes; and
           </li>
           <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B3d">
            A lasting improvement in the region's competitive position within the travel/tourism industry, as well as the region's ability to attract new businesses.
           </li>
          </ol>
         </li>
         <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B4">
          The citizens of the region have responded positively to WBRC 2012's efforts and solidly embraced the cause to host the Olympic Games, expressed in part by the endorsement of scores of local business, civic, governmental, academic, and amateur sports organizations, and by survey results that show (i) eighty-two percent of the region's residents support the effort to bring the 2012 Olympic Games to this area and (ii) eighty-six percent of area residents believe that the Olympic Games will bring substantial economic benefits to our region.
         </li>
         <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B5">
          Through the submission of the region's official bid proposal to the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) on December 15, 2000, WBRC 2012 reached a milestone in the process of capturing the Olympic Games by providing a 631-page logistical, operational, and financial blueprint for hosting the 2012 Games.
         </li>
         <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B6">
          The bid proposal highlights the great venues and vistas found in our region and is developed around key principles, including (i) building less, not more and (ii) utilizing mass transit, and (iii) protecting the environment.
         </li>
         <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B7">
          In addition to the region's bid proposal, the USOC and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) require certain government guarantees and commitments in conjunction with hosting the 2012 Olympic Games, should our region win the U.S. Candidate City designation.
         </li>
         <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B8">
          Our unique regional approach to winning the right to host the Olympic Games creates the added complication of determining which entities will provide the necessary guarantees.
         </li>
         <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B9">
          It is incumbent upon WBRC 2012 and government leaders to move forward together now to craft the solution that best "lives regionalism" and maximizes the region's chances of winning the 2012 Olympic Games, and reaping the many benefits that come with this honor.
         </li>
         <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1B10">
          Given that all four jurisdictions, Virginia, Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Baltimore, will host a significant number of events and reap substantial benefits, the most effective solution for all four jurisdictions is to enter into a single agreement that gives the USOC (and subsequently the IOC) a single focal point and a united front that reflects the regional nature of our bid.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1C">
        The Regional Authority shall, if ever brought into existence, cease to exist by the force of this Compact on January 1, 2014, unless extended by substantially similar future legislation passed by each of the Signatories.
       </li>
       <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1D">
        Until such time as the Regional Authority comes into existence, the combined signatures of the Governors of Virginia and Maryland, and the Mayors of the District of Columbia and Baltimore, on any and all documents necessary and appropriate to the pursuit of the 2012 Olympic Games shall be deemed binding on future actions of the Regional Authority.

Any voting member of the Regional Authority may succeed himself.

       <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1F">
        The Regional Authority shall elect from its membership a chair, a vice-chair, a secretary, and a treasurer. Such officers shall serve for such terms as shall be prescribed by resolution of the Regional Authority or until their successors are elected and qualified. No voting member of the Regional Authority shall hold more than one office on the Regional Authority.
       </li>
       <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1G">
        Regular meetings of the Regional Authority shall be held on such dates and at such time and place as shall be fixed by resolution of the Regional Authority. Special meetings of the Regional Authority may be called by resolution of the authority, by the chairman or vice-chairman, or upon the written request of at least three voting members of the Regional Authority. Written notice of all meetings shall be delivered to each voting member, not less than three days prior to the date of the meeting in the case of regular meetings and not less than twenty-four hours in the case of special meetings.
       </li>
       <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1H">
        A majority of the voting members of the Regional Authority shall constitute a quorum. A majority of the quorum is empowered to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the Regional Authority and no vacancy on the Regional Authority shall impair the right of such majority to act. If at any meeting there is less than a quorum present, a majority of those present may adjourn the meeting to a fixed time and place, and notice of the time and place shall be given in accordance with subsection G, provided that if the notice period required by subsection G cannot reasonably be complied with, such notice, if any, of such adjourned meeting shall be given as is reasonably practical.

       <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1I">

       <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc59s2.2-5900ol1J">
        The Regional Authority shall make provision for a system of financial accounting and controls, audits, and reports. All accounting systems and records, auditing procedures and standards, and financial reporting shall conform to generally accepted principles of governmental accounting. All financial records, reports, and documents of the Regional Authority shall be public records and open to public inspection under reasonable regulations prescribed by the Regional Authority.

      <p>
       The General Assembly hereby enacts and the Commonwealth of Virginia hereby enters into, the Mid-Atlantic Offshore Wind Energy Infrastructure Development Compact in the form substantially as follows:
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Article I.
      </p>
      <p>
       Policy and Purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       The party states recognize that in order to reduce energy dependency there is a need to fully explore the use of all energy sources. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis; it is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort to improve the development of offshore wind energy infrastructure and operations with the objective of contributing to greater energy independence and improving the individual and community well-being of the citizens of the party states.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Extensive regional coordination among decision-makers from different sectors including but not limited to regulators, utilities and project developers, is required for the most efficient use of investment capital and available energy resources. If states act independently in planning the development of their offshore wind resources, there are likely to be "boom and bust" effects on local economic development in the party states. In addition, coordinated planning is essential to develop an appropriate offshore electric power cable transmission network, to which offshore wind projects can interconnect without each project having its own power cable to shore, in order to minimize potential conflicts with other ocean users and to minimize the number of cable shore crossings and attendant environmental impacts in the environmentally sensitive coastal zones of each of the party states. Finally, collaborative research is needed to accurately model the Mid-Atlantic and southeastern offshore wind resource, which spans multiple states, and its interaction with the electric utility grid, which also spans multiple states.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Article II.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agreement.
      </p>

      <ol>
       <li id="t2.2sIIp0Cc60a02s2.2-6000ol11">
