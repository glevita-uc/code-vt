    Revision of Constitution.
   </b>
   - A general revision of the Constitution of Virginia was proposed and agreed to by the General Assembly at the 1969 Extra Session (Acts 1969, Ex. Sess., c. 27) and referred to the 1970 session. It was again agreed to at that session (Acts 1970, cc. 763, 786) and was ratified by the people on Nov. 3, 1970.
  </p>
  <p>
   Three other constitutional amendments were ratified by the people at the election held Nov. 3, 1970. The amendment proposed and agreed to by Acts 1969, Ex. Sess., c. 30, and Acts 1970, cc. 763, 787, added subdivision (b) to Art. X,

        As to validity of Constitution,
       </b>
       <p>
        - All provisions of the Constitution should be construed together whenever possible. If there is conflict, however, the specific provision must govern over the general provision. In applying those principles, when an act is adopted in the manner prescribed by and pursuant to the authority of a specifically drawn section of the Constitution, its validity is unassailable upon the grounds of unconstitutionality under the more general provisions of other sections of the Constitution. Miller v. Ayres, 213 Va. 251, 191 S.E.2d 261 (1972).

        which is guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and of this State embraces not only the right to go where one chooses, but to do such acts as he may judge best for his own interest not inconsistent with the equal rights of others, to follow such pursuits as he may deem best adapted to his faculties and will afford him the highest enjoyment, to be free in the enjoyment of all of his faculties, to be free to use them in all lawful ways, to live and work where he will, and, to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling, and for that purpose to enter into and enforce all contracts which he may deem proper, necessary and essential to successfully conduct his private concerns. Young v. Commonwealth, 101 Va. 853, 45 S.E. 327 (1903). See also

       <p>
        An act is not invalid if within the sphere of its operation all persons subject to it are treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions, both in the privileges conferred and in the liabilities imposed. Bryce v. Gillespie, 160 Va. 137, 168 S.E. 653 (1933).

        - When one parent asserts the child's explicit constitutional right to life as the basis for continuing medical treatment and the other is asserting the nebulous liberty interest in refusing life-saving treatment on behalf of a minor child, the explicit right to life must prevail. In re Baby "K", 832 F. Supp. 1022 (E.D. Va. 1993), aff'd, 16 F.3d 590 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 825, 115 S. Ct. 91, 130 L. Ed. 2d 42 (1994).

        - A municipality, as a creation of the legislature subject to extinction by the legislature, is not a man within the contemplation of this section and therefore, has no standing to challenge a legislative act affecting rights under this section. Commonwealth, Dep't of State Police v. Hines, 221 Va. 626, 272 S.E.2d 210 (1980).

        - Independently of the Constitution, the private property of one person cannot be transferred to another against his consent, with or without compensation. Private ownership of property is one of the fundamental rights of the citizen not surrendered by entering into organized government. But the rights of the public are superior to those of the individual, and if private property is needed for a "public use," it may be taken for that purpose by the legislature either directly or through such agencies as it may designate, but even then it cannot be either "taken or damaged" without making just compensation therefor.

        - The only valid authority which a state has to prohibit, regulate or control the private business of a citizen grows out of its "police power," or power to enact laws pertaining to the public health, the public safety or the public morals.

        The legislature may not, under the guise of protecting the public interests, arbitrarily interfere with private business, or impose unusual or unnecessary restrictions upon lawful occupations. Young v. Commonwealth, 101 Va. 853, 45 S.E. 327 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rights herein mentioned embrace all businesses that are legitimate in character, and are of such nature as to indicate that they are inherent in the individual claiming them. But this doctrine has no application to the inhibition or regulation of that which the claimant has no inherent right to do. Taylor v. Smith, 140 Va. 217, 124 S.E. 259 (1924).

        Acting under the grant of
    56 of the Constitution of 1902, the legislature empowered circuit judges to fill vacancies on boards of supervisors, regardless of the cause of the vacancy, and it specifically provided that this power could be exercised even though the vacancy was created by the court's own order in redistricting a county. This delegation of the appointive power to judges was held not to conflict with the doctrine of separation of powers found in
    5 and 39 of the Constitution of 1902. Avens v. Wright, 320 F. Supp. 677 (W.D. Va. 1970).

        - The enactment by a County Board of Supervisors of a meals tax ordinance with a rate of 1% after voters of that county gave their approval to a meals tax at a higher rate by a referendum vote is a valid exercise of the statutory authority granted to the Board of Supervisors to levy a meals tax in an amount and on such terms as that governing body may by ordinance prescribe. See opinion of the Attorney General to Michael McHale Collins, Esq., Attorney for Bath County, Virginia, Collins & Hepler, PLC, 10-053, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 87 (12/27/10).

       <p>
        - Governor's assertion of "absolute" power to issue an executive order to restore political rights ran afoul of the separation-of-powers principle; the executive order sought not to mitigate the impact of the voter-disqualification rule of law on an individualized basis but to supersede it entirely for an indiscriminately configured class of approximately 206,000 convicted felons, without any regard for their individual circumstances and without any specific request by individuals seeking relief. Howell v. McAuliffe, 292 Va. 320, 788 S.E.2d 706 (2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 657, 2017 U.S. LEXIS 89, 196 L. Ed. 2d 548 (U.S. 2017).

        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Executive Order that sought to restore the political rights of any persons disqualified by the voter-disqualification provision was in violation of that provision and the anti-suspension provision because the Executive Order had the attributes of an ultra vires assertion of the suspending power that had been forbidden by the Virginia Constitution since 1776. Howell v. McAuliffe, 292 Va. 320, 788 S.E.2d 706 (2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 657, 2017 U.S. LEXIS 89, 196 L. Ed. 2d 548 (U.S. 2017).

        § 8. Criminal prosecutions.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <br/>
      <p>
       That in criminal prosecutions a man hath a right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation, to be confronted with the accusers and witnesses, and to call for evidence in his favor, and he shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of his vicinage, without whose unanimous consent he cannot be found guilty. He shall not be deprived of life or liberty, except by the law of the land or the judgment of his peers, nor be compelled in any criminal proceeding to give evidence against himself, nor be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       Laws may be enacted providing for the trial of offenses not felonious by a court not of record without a jury, preserving the right of the accused to an appeal to and a trial by jury in some court of record having original criminal jurisdiction. Laws may also provide for juries consisting of less than twelve, but not less than five, for the trial of offenses not felonious, and may classify such cases, and prescribe the number of jurors for each class.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       In criminal cases, the accused may plead guilty. If the accused plead not guilty, he may, with his consent and the concurrence of the attorney for the Commonwealth and of the court entered of record, be tried by a smaller number of jurors, or waive a jury. In case of such waiver or plea of guilty, the court shall try the case.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section shall be self-executing.

        - In a prosecution for the offense of unlawfully and feloniously operating a motor vehicle after having been declared an habitual offender and while the order of court prohibiting such operation remained in effect, the refusal of the trial court to instruct on the presumption of innocence, even if assumed to be error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where the evidence of guilt was uncontroverted and overwhelming, where the defendant's substantial rights were not affected in any way, and where there was no likelihood that the giving of the instruction would have altered the sentence, which was one year above the minimum; but the decision should not be taken as a signal that the Supreme Court has softened its adherence to the principle that the accused is entitled in most every case to an instruction on the presumption of innocence.

        - An act creating a statutory offense, to be valid, must specify with reasonable certainty and definiteness the conduct which is commanded or prohibited, that is, what must be done or avoided, so that a person of ordinary intelligence may know what is thereby required of him. The enactment should define the acts to be done or not to be done which constitute such offense with such certainty that a person may determine whether or not he has violated the law at the time he does or fails to do the act, which is charged to be a violation thereof. Unless an act creating a statutory offense satisfies this requirement of certainty and definiteness it violates the due process clauses of the Virginia Constitution. Peacock v. Commonwealth, 200 Va. 464, 106 S.E.2d 659 (1959), quoting Caldwell v. Commonwealth, 198 Va. 454, 94 S.E.2d 537 (1956).

        Defendant's counsel, in his summation, represented to the jury that the defendant did not testify because "we don't feel . . . the jury are going to convict . . . on the evidence of two convicted felons" and because "we didn't think it was necessary." By so doing, the defense invited the prosecution's response, which did not go beyond meeting the argument advanced by the defendant.

Once a witness asserts his Fifth Amendment right, some investigative questioning must be allowed, for it is well settled that the "prosecutor need not accept at face value every asserted claim of privilege, no matter how frivolous."

The Constitution of Virginia likewise confers a right to a witness to be free from being compelled "to give evidence against himself." Cunningham v. Commonwealth, 2 Va.

       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant invoked the right to remain silent, the statements made thereafter to police were properly admitted into evidence because defendant's question to police, "Can we just talk later?" was related generally to the pending investigation and thus the statements that followed were part of a conversation voluntarily reinitiated by defendant.

        Trial court did not err in ruling that a prosecutor's remarks during rebuttal closing argument did not amount to an adverse comment on defendant's failure to testify because the prosecutor could properly comment on the fact that defendant was hiding or otherwise fleeing to avoid detection; without objection, the jury was instructed that if a person fled to avoid detection, apprehension, or arrest, that created no presumption that the person was guilty of having committed a crime, but it was a circumstance that the jury could consider along with the other evidence.

Even despite the fact that defendant had pled guilty to the underlying offenses while continuing to proclaim that defendant was innocent, the issue was not defendant's refusal to admit what defendant had done, but defendant's refusal to cooperatively participate in the sex offender treatment program.

        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress statements he made to a police detective on the ground that he mistakenly believed that the detective was interviewing him for the purposes of obtaining a plea bargain as it was defendant's mistaken belief, not any coercive activity by the detective, which led to defendant's statements.

        Defendant's constitutional right under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to remain silent was not violated by a detective testifying as a rebuttal witness to impeach defendant's testimony about defendant having acted in self-defense as a recent fabrication presented for the first time from the witness stand because the record did not show that defendant's silence was in response to any Miranda warnings that defendant received.

        With regard to defendant's convictions on two capital murder counts and the imposition of two death sentences against him, the trial court did not commit reversible error by permitting the prosecutor to comment on defendant's lack of remorse because several witnesses, including mental health experts, were asked during the resentencing proceeding whether defendant had expressed any remorse, and they said no, thus, the Commonwealth's comment on defendant's lack of remorse was not a comment on his failure to testify, but rather a comment on the evidence that had been presented.

        Trial court did not err when it found defendant in violation of the terms of his probation and revoked a portion of his suspended sentence because defendant's constitutional self-incrimination rights were not violated since "incrimination" was not present where any admission of guilt by defendant could not result in future prosecution and would be barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, defendant faced no possibility of criminal prosecution for admitting the crimes for which he had already been convicted, and his Alford plea of guilty did not affect his obligation to comply with a treatment requirement that he admit his guilt.

        - In prosecution for grand larceny of store merchandise, trial court erred in admitting evidence that defendant had not produced a receipt for the stolen goods when confronted by store's loss prevention manager, whom the police brought to defendant while he was in custody; this was equivalent to proving silence in the face of an accusation, and impermissibly burdened defendant's exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination.

        - The double jeopardy provision is designed to serve as a bar against repeated attempts to convict, with consequent subjection of the defendant to embarrassment, expense, anxiety, and insecurity, and to the possibility that he may be found guilty even though innocent. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 736, 273 S.E.2d 784, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 920, 102 S. Ct. 422, 70 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1981).

        - A person may not be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense. This prohibition provides three distinct guarantees. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. Jordan v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 590, 347 S.E.2d 152 (1986).

        - The double jeopardy clauses of the United States and Virginia Constitutions bar prosecution of a criminal charge against an accused already convicted of an identical or lesser included offense. Rouzie v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 174, 207 S.E.2d 854 (1974).
        <b>
         Effect of double jeopardy clause.

       </p>
       <p>
        The double jeopardy clauses forbid not only subsequent punishment but subsequent prosecution. Jones v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 757, 240 S.E.2d 658, cert. denied, 435 U.S. 909, 98 S. Ct. 249, 55 L. Ed. 2d 500, 439 U.S. 892, 99 S. Ct. 249, 58 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The double jeopardy clause of the Constitution will act as a bar to prosecution only if the offenses are identical or if one offense is necessarily included in the other offense. Comer v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 246, 176 S.E.2d 432 (1970).
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p>
        - The double jeopardy clause applies when (1) the two offenses involved are identical, (2) the former offense is lesser-included in the subsequent offense, and (3) the subsequent offense is lesser-included in the former offense. Martin v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 720, 273 S.E.2d 778 (1981).
        <b>
         When double jeopardy clause applicable.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The double jeopardy clauses of the federal Constitution and of the Virginia Constitution forbid not only subsequent punishment but subsequent prosecution, and those clauses apply not only when the two offenses are identical, but also when the former offense is lesser-included in the subsequent offense and also when the subsequent offense is lesser-included in the former offense. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 736, 273 S.E.2d 784, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 920, 102 S. Ct. 422, 70 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1981).
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p>
        - The Double Jeopardy Clause is not an absolute bar to successive trials. The general rule is that it does not bar reprosecution of a defendant whose conviction is overturned on appeal save in the limited instance where reversal is required because of insufficient evidence. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 17 Va. App. 551, 439 S.E.2d 622, aff'd upon reh'g en banc, 18 Va. App. 814, 447 S.E.2d 542 (1994).

        - Virginia's Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA) [see now
    37.2-900 et seq.], was affirmed because: (1) there were proper procedures and evidentiary safeguards; (2) the SVPA satisfied the requirement that there be a finding of dangerousness either to one's self or to others; and (3) proof of dangerousness and lack of control was linked to the condition of the person. Furthermore, the SVPA was a non-punitive, civil commitment statute and as such did not violate the guarantees against double jeopardy or ex post facto lawmaking. Shivaee v. Commonwealth, 270 Va. 112, 613 S.E.2d 570, 2005 Va. LEXIS 68, cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1005, 126 S. Ct. 626, 163 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2005).

       <p>
        In a civil proceeding in which defendant was found to be a sexually violent predator, the introduction of evidence from an earlier criminal trial in which defendant had been tried for rape and acquitted by a jury did not violate double jeopardy protections. Ellison v. Commonwealth, 273 Va. 254, 639 S.E.2d 209, 2007 Va. LEXIS 15 (2007).

        - In an appeal by the Commonwealth of a trial court's order dismissing an indictment against defendant on double jeopardy grounds, the appellate court concluded that the trial court correctly decided that defendant's trial was terminated because there was insufficient evidence to prove that defendant had stolen money from the victim. Defendant was acquitted of grand larceny, and the Commonwealth could not name a different victim and relitigate the issue at a second trial in hopes of achieving a conviction. Commonwealth v. Flythe, No. 0592-15-4, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 251 (Sept. 1, 2015).

        - The general rule, supported by the weight of authority and the best considered cases, is that when a person has been placed on trial, on a valid indictment, before a court of competent jurisdiction, has been arraigned, has pleaded, and a jury has been impaneled and sworn, he is in jeopardy. Rosser v. Commonwealth, 159 Va. 1028, 167 S.E. 257 (1933).

        If the Supreme Court were to "rehear, reverse and annul" a judgment of acquittal in a criminal prosecution for violation of a municipal taxing ordinance and enter an order of conviction against the accused, or direct that he be tried again by the lower court for the same offense of which he was there acquitted, the result would be to place the accused "twice in jeopardy" for the same offense, in violation of this section. City of Roanoke v. Donckers, 187 Va. 491, 47 S.E.2d 440 (1948).

        It is generally recognized that a nolle prosequi, if entered before jeopardy attached, does not bar further prosecution for the offense. Cummings v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. App. 248, 481 S.E.2d 493 (1997).

        - The question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible is not different from the question of what punishment the legislature authorized. The legislature in its discretion may determine the appropriate "unit of prosecution" and set the penalty for separate violations. The double jeopardy clauses prohibit the courts from exceeding the legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same offense. Jordan v. Commonwealth, 2 Va.

        - To determine whether the firing of multiple shots from one vehicle towards another constitutes a single violation or multiple violations of the statutes against maliciously shooting at an occupied motor vehicle and intentionally discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle, the court must determine what punishment was intended and authorized by the legislature; it is judicial punishment in excess of legislative intent which offends the double jeopardy clause.

        In determining whether both indictments charged the same offense the test generally applied is that when the facts necessary to convict on the second prosecution would necessarily have convicted on the first, a final judgment on the first prosecution will be a bar to the second, but if the facts which will convict on the second prosecution would not necessarily have convicted on the first, then the first will not be a bar to the second, although the offenses charged may have been committed by the same state of facts.

       <p>
        In Virginia and elsewhere, the "same evidence" test is the standard for determining whether different offenses are deemed the same for double jeopardy purposes. To determine whether two offenses are different, the test is whether one offense requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not, even though each offense may arise from the same transaction and some of the same acts may be necessary to prove both. If proof of an additional fact is required, an acquittal or conviction under either is not a bar to prosecution and conviction under the other. Jones v.

Double jeopardy did not apply because: (1) defendant's offenses were considered in a single proceeding and, thus, there were not successive prosecutions for the same offense; and (2) solicitation to commit murder and attempted capital murder for hire were not the same offenses and, thus, defendant could be convicted and punished for both offenses since solicitation for murder required that a defendant solicit another person whereas attempted capital murder for hire did not require such proof.

Federal courts have no right to sit in judgment of such determinations of state constitutional law, where, as here, the federal right has been protected. They have even less right to do so (if that is possible) on the strength of nothing more than a guess, based upon a vote by an intermediate state court to rehear a case en banc, as to how state law might develop in the future. That ultimately the state double jeopardy right might develop so as to provide broader protection that the federal counterpart is of no moment for defendant's federal double jeopardy claim.

        - This section incorporated for the first time, in the fundamental written law of the State, the well known common-law doctrine of former jeopardy. When the purpose of an appeal in a criminal case is to procure on behalf of the State a reversal of the judgment and a new trial of the accused (as distinguished from a mere review and decision of the legal question involved for use as a precedent in future cases), the rule against a second jeopardy for the same offense operates proprio vigore to destroy the right of appeal. The matter is jurisdictional, and the accused is not obliged, first, to abide the result of the appeal, and, in the event of a reversal, resort to his plea of former jeopardy to avoid a second trial.

        - In all cases, civil as well as criminal, a person hailed into court has the right to demand that he be told in plain, intelligent language what is the cause of the complaint against him; and this right, insofar as it relates to crimes, is guaranteed by both the federal and state Constitutions.

Farewell v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 475, 189 S.E. 321 (1937).

        - Defendant's due process rights were violated when the Commonwealth failed to timely disclose that a convicted felon and thief, who worked at defendant's place of employment, had been caught trying to steal from the cash drawer because the evidence was material and the prosecutor's disclosure at trial did not cure the violation, as it was made only after defendant had concluded his direct examination and did not allow defense counsel an opportunity to utilize the evidence in his preparation for trial.

        Commonwealth did not deprive defendant of due process by withholding or failing to preserve exculpatory evidence because the Commonwealth's failure to disclose a video tape and cell phones, which disappeared from an investigator's custody, did not constitute a Brady violation. Defendant did not meet his burden of showing that either the police or the Commonwealth acted in bad faith in losing the tape and cell phones, and nothing in the record indicated that the police had knowledge that those pieces of evidence were exculpatory.

        a defendant's right of confrontation is violated and the witness's direct testimony should be stricken. But where a witness refuses to answer only one or a few questions on cross-examination, the right to confrontation is not necessarily violated. Whether the direct testimony should be stricken as violative of the confrontation clause is within the discretion of the trial court, considering factors such as the motive of the witness, the materiality of the answer, and the effectiveness of the cross-examination.

The judge could reasonably believe witness's reason in light of the fact that he had answered in detail every other question propounded to him by either the Commonwealth or the defendant and witness' source of cocaine was not relevant to the question of the defendant's guilt, and the defendant was given an opportunity on cross-examination and during closing argument to expose this infirmity "thereby calling to the attention of the fact-finder the reasons for giving scant weight" testimony. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike witness's direct testimony. Nichols v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 426, 369 S.E.2d 218 (1988).

        - A defendant's right to call for evidence in his favor guarantees him sufficient time to investigate and evaluate the evidence in preparation for trial. However, the need to investigate and evaluate the evidence and the prejudice allegedly resulting from the denial of a continuance cannot be based upon mere speculation. Cardwell v.

    A defendant's constitutional due process right to a fair trial includes the right to call for evidence in his favor.
    Due process seeks to prevent a miscarriage of justice by ensuring to the defendant a fair and impartial trial, thereby assuring "the justice of the finding of guilt."
    A prosecutor may not avoid this discovery requirement by strategically mischaracterizing a witness held in abeyance as a "potential" witness. Moreno v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 408, 392 S.E.2d 836 (1990).

        - Some of the factors which courts should assess in determining whether a particular defendant has been deprived of his right to a speedy trial are length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.

         Factors in determining deprivation of right.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant who fails to demand a speedy trial does not forever waive his right. This does not mean, however, that the defendant has no responsibility to assert his right. The defendant's assertion of or failure to assert his right to a speedy trial is one of the factors to be considered in an inquiry into the deprivation of the right. Fowlkes v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 763, 240 S.E.2d 662 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        While simple negligence on the part of the Commonwealth may be a "more neutral reason" than deliberate procrastination, administrative derelictions nevertheless should be considered in determining whether a defendant's right to a speedy trial has been denied since the ultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest with the government rather than with the defendant. Fowlkes v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 763, 240 S.E.2d 662 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Concerning the constitutional right to a speedy trial, the Supreme Court of the United States has defined a balancing test to be applied by the courts on an ad hoc basis. It identified four factors to be considered: (1) length of delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the defendant's assertion of his right and (4) prejudice to the defendant. The length of the delay is the triggering mechanism. Unless there is delay which is presumptively prejudicial, it is unnecessary to inquire as to the other factors. A process which results in a trial on the merits within the statutorily described time does not support a presumption of prejudice. Sheard v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 227, 403 S.E.2d 178 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a delay is not shown to be "presumptively prejudicial," there is no necessity for inquiry into the additional speedy trial factors; a defendant must be able to at least raise the presumption that the delay was so detrimental as to have endangered his right to a fair trial, which the defendant here was unable to do. Riddick v. Commonwealth, 22 Va. App. 136, 468 S.E.2d 135 (1996).

         The failure to show actual prejudice to the defense is no longer fatal
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's failure to make an evidentiary showing of actual prejudice to his defense was not fatal to his speedy trial claim. Fowlkes v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 763, 240 S.E.2d 662 (1978).

        - Defendant's right to a speedy trial under U.S. Const. Amend. VI and Va. Const., Art. I,
    8 was not violated because the trial court granted a motion for nolle prosequi of the first indictment against defendant for good cause, and the time between the second indictment of defendant and defendant's conviction did not violate defendant's right to a speedy trial as he was not prejudiced by the delay.

        - When a defendant challenges the delay of his trial as unreasonable, the burden devolves upon the Commonwealth to show, first, what delay was attributable to the defendant and not to be counted against the Commonwealth and, second, what part of any delay attributable to the prosecution was justifiable. This rule accords with the holding in
    Flanary v. Commonwealth,
    184 Va. 204, 35 S.E.2d 135 (1945), that the burden is on the Commonwealth to show that the delay proscribed by

        Defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not denied, as the delay between the initial trial and final retrial was not of sufficient time to impair his constitutional right to a speedy trial, and even though he asserted his right to a speedy trial, he failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting from the delay.

        - The burden was upon defendants to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they were denied a public trial. However, upon a showing that the trial was held within the perimeter walls of a medium security prison, the defendants proved a prima facie case of denial of a public trial. Although the burden of persuasion remains upon defendant throughout the trial, once the prima facie case is made, the burden of going forward with the evidence shifts to the Commonwealth and it is incumbent upon it to produce evidence to justify the transfer of the trial from the regular courthouse to another location.

The fact that he does not, or is unable to do so, and thus solve the doubt, is sufficient to disqualify him. Durham v. Cox, 328 F. Supp. 1157 (W.D. Va. 1971).

        In many cases in which the seating of a juror challenged for bias has been upheld, the challenged juror has, upon his voir dire examination, stated unequivocally in one form or another that he could render a fair and impartial verdict uninfluenced by his preformed impression. Durham v. Cox, 328 F. Supp. 1157 (W.D. Va. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A juror who cannot unequivocally state, at the time of the trial, that he can give a defendant a fair and impartial trial, and whose answer, in response to questions concerning his bias, concludes with "Something would be there. I don't know.", is not an impartial juror within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment to the federal Constitution and this section. Durham v. Cox, 328 F. Supp. 1157 (W.D. Va. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The material point for consideration in the answer of a juror as to the juror's impartiality is his inability or unwillingness to state how far his judgment would be affected by his preconceived opinions. Where his response to the inquiry of a court to his impartiality is that he could "not now say that he had such opinion that evidence would not remove it," and where he did not say that the opinion was of such a character that evidence would remove it, indicating that he was in doubt whether the opinion he had formed would yield to the testimony to be adduced on the trial, he has not removed doubt as to his impartiality. Durham v. Cox, 328 F. Supp. 1157 (W.D. Va. 1971).

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike a juror who worked with a sexual assault prevention team and with sexual assault victims in a trial where the defendant was accused of sexually assaulting a woman since the juror stated that he could be impartial and listen objectively to the evidence.

        Trial court should have granted defendant's motion to strike a potential juror for cause, and the failure to strike was inherently prejudicial, because the potential juror held an opinion of a fixed character that repelled the presumption of defendant's innocence; although the potential juror recognized that everyone was presumed innocent, he conceded that he still would "probably" have a problem with the presumption of defendant's innocence, and the Commonwealth's single rehabilitative question could not serve to fully rehabilitate the potential juror since nothing in his answer explained how he resolved the contradiction between his professed problem with the presumption of innocence and his ability to follow the law.

        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to strike a juror for cause, as the juror's own statements demonstrated that he was able to sit as an impartial juror.

    motion presented sufficient facts to establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination under circumstances in which the Commonwealth used all its peremptory strikes to eliminate white females, ages 40 to 67, from the jury, resulting in a predominantly male jury; the record did not support the trial court's ruling that the Commonwealth offered a gender-neutral reason for the strikes. The only other explanation offered by the Commonwealth was that the stricken female jurors and defendant were members of the same age group and it was based primarily on whether or not they would be more favorable in their deliberations towards the Commonwealth's position than the defense.

        Where there was no indication that the trial court required the defendant at any time prior to the trial date to elect either trial by jury or trial by bench, and nothing in the record showed that the defendant knew of his right to trial by jury, the defendant did not waive his right to a jury trial.

        - Where a defendant waives trial by jury, even though the order of conviction does not expressly recite the concurrence of the court in the waiver, the requirement of the Constitution that such concurrence be entered of record is met, because such concurrence can be fairly inferred from the statement in the order that the court, after the waiver, heard the case without a jury. However, since the concurrence of the prosecuting attorney is also required to be entered of record and such concurrence could not be fairly inferred from the order, it is fatally defective and the omission cannot be supplied by order nunc pro tunc.

       <p>
        A motion to withdraw a waiver of a jury trial made 11 days before the defendant's cases were set for trial was seasonably made and the trial judge abused his discretion in denying the defendant the right to withdraw his waiver where the motion was not for the purpose of delay, and granting the motion would not have resulted in an unreasonable delay of the trial thereby impeding the cause of justice. Thomas v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 553, 238 S.E.2d 834 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of defendant's motion to withdraw his waiver of his right to a jury trial was improper because the record failed to show that the motion was made solely for the purpose of delay or whether defendant's request for a jury trial could have been accommodated at the time it was made. The record also failed to disclose the number of witnesses that would have been inconvenienced by the continuance, or the difficulty that rescheduling the trial would present to those witnesses.

        - Nothing in the law authorizes a trial court to change a defendant's plea of not guilty to guilty, even when the defendant essentially admits his guilt on the witness stand. The trial court erred in informing the defendant that the defendant's plea would be changed to guilty should he testify and admit his guilt, thereby depriving the defendant of his right to have the jury determine guilt and impose sentence.

        - Trial court abused its discretion by failing either to declare a mistrial or to set aside the verdict finding defendant guilty of conspiracy to commit grand larceny of property worth $200 or more because without the slightest prompting, the jurors volunteered to the trial court that they "misread" and "obviously misunderstood" the conspiracy instruction and sought, without success, to reconsider their guilty verdict on the conspiracy charge, and it only made matters worse that the jurors were more confused than they even knew; despite the clarity of the conspiracy instruction and the trial court's efforts to reply to the jury's concerns, the jury persisted in the mistaken belief that it had convicted defendant of a conspiracy charge that required a finding that he committed grand larceny.

        - Based on the questioning tone in defendant's voice at the time defendant allegedly requested counsel, the content of defendant's statements, and defendant's body language, defendant's statements did not amount to an unequivocal assertion of the right to counsel; therefore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress.

       <p>
        Defendant's motion to suppress statements made during a custodial interrogation was properly denied because defendant's statement to an officer regarding talking to defendant's lawyer was unclear and ambiguous and, thus, did not constitute an invocation of the right to counsel since the statement was made in direct response to an officer's question regarding defendant's version of events and the statement expressed defendant's desire to keep defendant's story the same until defendant spoke with an attorney, rather than delineated defendant's desire to terminate the interrogation until defendant had access to an attorney.

        Defendant's conviction for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon did not invoke double jeopardy because in contrast to using a firearm to commit a felony, of which he was acquitted, his possession conviction was based on the fact that there was sufficient evidence he possessed a firearm; the fact that similar evidence was used to prove the two crimes was not unique, and the fact that evidence for both charges consisted of witness testimony did not invoke Double Jeopardy Clause concerns.

        Conviction under the Firearm Use Statute requires that the Commonwealth prove the defendant committed one of the listed felonies, and a conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon does not require that a felony be committed while possessing the firearm but that the defendant be a convicted felon; although a defendant acquitted of an underlying felony cannot be convicted of using a firearm in the commission of a felony he may nevertheless be convicted under the Firearm Possession Statute.

        Defendant's motion to dismiss the charges against him based on double jeopardy was denied as the court found manifest necessity to discharge the jury because defense counsel's comment that defendant had served eight months in jail was irrelevant to a determination of his guilt or innocence; the comment could appeal to the sympathy of the jury - a presumed innocent defendant already behind bars - or to the passion of the jury, suggesting defendant was being held based upon a fabrication by the victim; it could encourage an acquittal irrespective of the evidence and permit the jury to impose a sentence less than the statutory minimum, which it lacked the authority to do, by finding defendant not guilty; and it could deny him a fair trial.

However, the trial court found that a later indictment against the defendant for the same crimes that was obtained upon the defendant's release from the hospital could not be dismissed on the ground of the passage of time as the defendant alleged.

        Denial of Sixth Amendment speedy trial right was not available in a claim of pre-indictment delay; rather, pre-indictment delay involved a due process right. However, a due process violation claim was not supported by evidence that the Commonwealth intentionally delayed an indictment or that defendant was thereby prejudiced; the fact that defendant's high-quality counsel was unable to consolidate the indictment's charges with other charges for a favorable sentencing consideration created no substantive or procedural right.

        - Court denied petitioner's request for a writ of habeas corpus based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal due to his counsel's failure to assign cross-error in the Supreme Court of Virginia to the Court of Appeals' failure to address three evidentiary issues on which it had granted petitioner's appeal but which the Court of Appeals did not address in reversing his conviction, because it was reasonable for petitioner's counsel to have concluded that it was not necessary to bring the undecided assignments of error before the Supreme Court where the Court of Appeals never rendered any decision on the three issues and his counsel was not expected to anticipate the Supreme Court's change from its prior policy of remanding cases for further consideration of the unresolved issues.

These rights may include, but not be limited to, the following:

      <p>
       1. The right to protection from further harm or reprisal through the imposition of appropriate bail and conditions of release;

      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       This section does not confer upon any person a right to appeal or modify any decision in a criminal proceeding, does not abridge any other right guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States or this Constitution, and does not create any cause of action for compensation or damages against the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions, any officer, employee or agent of the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions, or any officer of the court.

       <p>
        - It has been uniformly held by the Supreme Court that the provisions of this section must be construed to impose no limitation upon the legislative right to determine and prescribe by statute the quantum of punishments deemed adequate by the legislature; that the only limitation so imposed is upon the mode of punishment, such punishments only being prohibited by this constitutional provision as were regarded as cruel and unusual when such provision was adopted in 1776, namely, such bodily punishments as involve torture or lingering death - such as are inhumane and barbarous - as, for example, punishment by the rack, by drawing and quartering, leaving the body hung in chains, or on the gibbet, exposed to public view. Hart v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 726, 109 S.E. 582 (1921).

       <b>
        This section limits mode of punishment.
       </b>
       <p>
        - The question of whether the provision of the Constitution as to cruel and unusual punishment imposes a limitation upon the legislative right, not only to determine and prescribe the mode of punishments, but also upon the quantum of punishments, is still an open one in Virginia. There is great force in the view that a statute might be enacted prescribing a punishment in quantum so severe for a comparatively trivial offense that it would be so out of proportion to the crime as to shock the conscience; and such statute might possibly be held in conflict with this section of the Constitution, although the mode of punishment was not unusual. Hart v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 726, 109 S.E. 582 (1921).

       <b>
        Limitation upon quantum of punishment still an open question.

       <p>
        - Where the sentence imposed is in excess of that prescribed by law, that part of the sentence which is excessive is invalid. A sentence in excess of one prescribed by law is not void ab initio because of the excess, but is good insofar as the power of the court extends, and is invalid only as to the excess. Deagle v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 304, 199 S.E.2d 509 (1973).

        To be an ex post facto law it must be a law which alters the rules of evidence and requires less or different testimony than the law required at the time of the commission of the offense, in order to convict the offender. There is no such thing as a vested right in the mere rules of evidence by which admissible facts are to be established. But a statute which so changes the rules of evidence as to permit a conviction on substantive evidence less or different from that required at the time of the commission of the act on which the prosecution is founded is to that extent clearly ex post facto and of no effect. Culbertson v. Commonwealth, 137 Va. 752, 119 S.E. 87 (1923).

Moreover, (1) the mere fact that some of defendant's acts proving his possession in September 2003 occurred before the change in the law did not preclude application of the new law, and (2) the trial court properly found that defendant continued to possess the child pornographic images at the time of his arrest, notwithstanding the date the pornographic images were originally downloaded.

        - General warrants, within this section, are search warrants issued "without any evidence of fact furnished previously to the issuance, or which do not designate any specific thing or person to be seized, or do not particularly describe the offense claimed to have been committed." Such search warrants would, if valid, authorize unreasonable searches and seizures, and for that reason they are condemned by this section; and in so doing this section merely adopts and makes unchangeable by the legislature the common law on the subject to that extent. McClannan v. Chaplain, 136 Va. 1, 116 S.E. 495 (1923); Zimmerman v. Town of Bedford, 134 Va. 787, 115 S.E. 362 (1922).

No right of property is primarily intended to be protected by the prohibition, and certain property rights are incidentally protected only because they are immediately incidental to and inseparable from the enjoyment of the personal rights.

         II. SEARCH WARRANTS.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        - Generally, police officers, before resorting to forced entry into premises to be searched under warrant, must attempt to gain admittance peaceably by announcing their presence, identifying themselves as police officers and stating their purpose. Gladden v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 595, 400 S.E.2d 791 (1991).
        <b>
         Police officers must attempt to gain admittance peaceably.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        After a proper "knock and announce," police detective reasonably concluded that defendant's wife had seen him through screen door and did not intend to let him in, and his subsequent entry through unlocked screen door was therefore appropriate. Simms v. Commonwealth, No. 1477-98-2, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 432 (Ct. of Appeals July 13, 1999).
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p>
        - The validity of a search where the police fail to announce their presence and request peaceful entry prior to a forcible entry is judged in terms of its reasonableness within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Const. and Art. I,
    10 of the Va. Const. Thus, Virginia has no absolute rule requiring a police officer to "knock and announce" in every situation when a search warrant is being executed. Commonwealth v. Viar, 15 Va. App. 490, 425 S.E.2d 86 (1992).

        - In
    Heaton v. Commonwealth,
    215 Va. 137, 207 S.E.2d 829 (1974), the court articulated the circumstances in which a "no-knock entry" would be considered reasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes:
    Exceptions to the general rule permit officers to make an unannounced entry where they have probable cause to believe that their peril would be increased if they announced their presence or that the unannounced entry is necessary to prevent persons within from escaping or destroying evidence. Gladden v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 595, 400 S.E.2d 791 (1991).
       </p>
       <i>

       <br/>
       <b>
        Circumstances in which a "no-knock" entry would be reasonable.
       </b>
       <p>
        - Upon hearing a motion to suppress, the trial judge must first determine whether the "knock and announce" doctrine applies. The threshold issue for such a determination is the method of entry used by the police. Commonwealth v. Viar, 15 Va. App. 490, 425 S.E.2d 86 (1992).
       </p>
       <br/>
       <b>
        Determining whether "knock and announce" doctrine applies.
       </b>
       <p>
        - The "knock and announce" doctrine does not apply when law-enforcement personnel have gained entry into a dwelling by consent, because no force is used under such circumstances. It is irrelevant that the police gained entry by ruse or stratagem, as long as the consent to enter was not revoked prior to the police identifying themselves. Commonwealth v. Viar, 15 Va. App. 490, 425 S.E.2d 86 (1992).

        - Where defendant made a general proffer that a trash can was beside the house, he presented no evidence concerning the proximity of the trash can to the house, nor the nature of the area surrounding the trash; thus, the trial court was presented with no evidence from which it could make a determination that the trash can was within the curtilage of the house. Askew v. Commonwealth, No. 1436-02-1, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 555 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 4, 2003).

        - Items seized pursuant to a search warrant were inadmissible into evidence because of the failure of the warrant to state the offense in relation to which the search was to be conducted, despite the fact that the affidavit contained the offense in relation to which the search was to be conducted, where the affidavit was not attached to the warrant until after the search warrant had been executed and the disputed items seized. Gilluly v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 38, 267 S.E.2d 105 (1980).

       <b>
        Failure of warrant to state the offense.
       </b>
       <p>
        - The controlling principle is that the evidence on which a search warrant may be issued does not have to be sufficient to establish the fact that the thing sought is on the premises, but merely that the belief of the person making the affidavit that it is there is based on facts which furnish a probable or reasonable cause for such belief. Tri-Pharmacy, Inc. v. United States, 203 Va. 723, 127 S.E.2d 89 (1962), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 962, 83 S. Ct. 542, 9 L. Ed. 2d 509 (1963).

        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence regarding drugs that were found when police went to defendant's apartment after securing a search warrant to look for documents that could establish that defendant owned or possessed a car that he drove off in after being stopped by a police officer on a highway for speeding and which killed the officer when it rolled over as defendant and the officer struggled for control of the car; probable cause supported the affidavit that police submitted to obtain the warrant since defendant claimed not to own the car, evidence to contradict that claim would reasonably be located at defendant's apartment along with his other personal papers, and police obtained an additional warrant regarding the drugs after finding the drugs while looking for evidence at the apartment. Gregory v. Commonwealth, 46 Va. App. 683, 621 S.E.2d 162, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 442 (2005).

        Where affidavit gave absolutely no indication that the fruits of criminal activity would be found at the defendants' home, probable cause to search was objectively unreasonable. Janis v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized as a result of a search warrant, where despite the fact that the affidavit supporting the same failed to provide the issuing magistrate with a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause to search defendant's home existed, officers possessed an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause, namely, that the fruits of criminal activity would probably be found at defendant's residence, for the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule to apply. Anzualda v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 764, 607 S.E.2d 749, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 88 (2005).

        - Although plaintiffs contended that the federal agents battered them by handcuffing them upon entry into their residence, and that the agents falsely imprisoned them by detaining them in handcuffs in the living room for several hours while the warrant was executed, the federal agents were executing a facially valid search warrant for the residence and plaintiffs were occupants of the residence at the time of the search; initially handcuffing plaintiffs was a reasonable decision, in order to preserve officer and occupant safety and to properly execute the warrant, and the agents' conduct was thus reasonable.

        - Although plaintiffs asserted that the federal agents assaulted them by forcing entry into their residence with a battering ram, and also by pointing firearms at them during the initial entry into the residence, the forced entry by the federal agents was reasonable and did not constitute an assault as the federal agents were entitled to consider the failure of plaintiffs to open the door as a refusal to permit entry in accordance with the warrant and they were thus justified in forcing entry into the residence and the federal agents were reasonably entitled to believe that the drawing of weapons was necessary in order to gain control of a fluid situation and ensure the safety of all involved.

        Trial court erred in granting both defendants' motions to suppress as the police officers use of force in making an arrest after the officers made a valid investigatory stop of defendant's vehicle was not a ground for granting those motions; the officers were permitted to order defendants out of the vehicle pending completion of the investigatory stop and the search and seizure of defendants was reasonable since it could not be said that absent the use of force, the officers would not have discovered the cocaine and firearm in the vehicle.

Those two suspects had retreated into a group of which the defendant had been a part, the events occurred in a high crime area and in front of a reputed crack house about which the police had received numerous "shots fired" complaints, and the police had ordered all bystanders to lie on the ground for their own protection as well as that of the police officers.

        Based on a citizen informant's statement that defendant confessed the burglary to her, the victim's information, and the victim's sister's statement that defendant's DVD collection was bigger after the burglary, the officer had probable cause to obtain a search warrant and to freeze the scene by excluding people from the premises for a reasonable time while obtaining a warrant; that same information provided officers with at least reasonable suspicion to detain defendant for a reasonable period of time while obtaining and executing a search warrant. Because the evidence supported a finding that the actions of the police were reasonable under the circumstances, their decision to freeze the scene by requiring defendant to stay and preventing others from entering did not compel the conclusion that her consent to the search of her house was involuntary, and, furthermore, the officers' failure to clearly indicate to defendant that she had a legal right to delimit the scope of the search did not compel the conclusion that her consent to search the house was involuntary; thus, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because she consented to both the entry and search of her residence.

       <p>
        - The seizure of defendant upon the initial stop at a license and sobriety checkpoint in question was constitutionally valid, where uniformed police officers, wearing reflector vests, were assigned to the scene, the area and the warning sign were well-lighted, there were two marked police vehicles present with red lights flashing, the geography of the site permitted adequate space for the momentary initial detention to check licenses and to afford space for vehicles, whose operators required further evaluation, to pull aside, the officers at the checkpoint had no discretion regarding which vehicles to stop and every southbound vehicle was halted, if congestion occurred, vehicles were permitted to move through the checkpoint until the congestion cleared, and the police endeavored to detain a motorist no more than 30 seconds for the license check. Balancing the state's strong interest in protecting the public from the grave risk presented by drunk drivers, against the minimal inconvenience caused motorists approaching the roadblock, the action of the police was not an impermissible infringement upon defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy.

        Trial court correctly refused to suppress either the weapon found on the defendant during a pat down search, following a tip from a concerned citizen that the defendant was brandishing a weapon, or the crack cocaine found on the defendant during a search incident to the defendant's arrest because the tip provided information permitting the officers to reasonably infer that it: (1) came from a concerned citizen making a contemporaneous, eyewitness report; (2) involved an open and obvious crime rather than mere concealed illegality; and (3) described criminality posing an imminent danger to the public; therefore, the officers correctly concluded the totality of the circumstances raised a reasonable suspicion to believe that criminal activity may be afoot.

        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence, as defendant did not show that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated when the officer stopped the vehicle after receiving a detailed report and confirming the information that he received to the effect that defendant was driving in an uncontrolled manner; the stop of defendant's vehicle was reasonable under the circumstances and evidence the officer found during the stop - beer containers in a cup holder, defendant's speech slurred, and defendant smelling of alcohol - provided probable cause to arrest defendant.

        Totality of circumstances supported an officer's reasonable suspicion to detain defendant because the officer observed a known drug user put his hands into a car in which defendant sat, the user withdrew his hands when he saw the officer approach, defendant moved his hands to the glove compartment and then to the floorboard, and the officer conducted a protective sweep.

       <p>
        Evidence supported the denial of defendant's motion to suppress because the police developed, first, reasonable suspicion for the detention and, then, probable cause for defendant's arrest, and the evidence supported a finding that, at the time of the seizure, reasonable suspicion existed to believe defendant could have been involved in a crime; when the officer first approached defendant she knew that he fit the robber's general description, defendant admitted that he had just come from the shopping center in which the robbery had occurred, and once the seizure had occurred, officers worked to confirm or dispel the suspicions supporting the detention.

        Trial court erred by suppressing evidence of marijuana and cocaine found on defendant's person on the grounds that the police officer's subjective intent to identify defendant was unreasonable because defendant's commission of several traffic infractions provided the officer an objectively reasonable basis to conduct an investigatory stop of his vehicle; therefore, it was irrelevant that the officer intended to stop defendant's vehicle for the purpose of determining if defendant was a person wanted for murder.

        - Trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence found on defendant, a member of a group that had been suspected of smoking marijuana; for the search to have been reasonable, the police had to show that they had a reasonable belief that defendant was armed and dangerous and, since they could not make that showing, the pat-down search of defendant was unjustified.

        Under the plain feel exception, the officer's belief that the substance was marijuana upon patting defendant's pocket and without further manipulating its contents, if found credible by the trial court, was sufficient to provide probable cause to seize the contents of the pocket; thus, where the events leading up to the same were consensual, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the contraband seized.

        Even assuming that the initial detention of defendant was lawful, the police officer's pat-down search of defendant violated defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment and Va. Const., Art. I,

The frisk of defendant was not supported by the reasonable belief that defendant was armed and presently dangerous and the inevitable discovery doctrine did not apply since the officer lacked probable cause to arrest defendant.

        Trial court should have suppressed evidence obtained in violation of defendant's Fourth Amendment rights in a case where a police officer testified that the officer knew capsules that the officer felt in defendant's left front pants pocket contained heroin because the officer's training and experience told the officer that was how heroin was packaged. The officer also admitted at the suppression hearing that some over-the-counter medications were packaged in capsules and, thus, it was not immediately apparent to the officer when the officer felt the capsules that they contained evidence of a crime.

        - Magistrate did not have a substantial basis for finding probable cause to issue a search warrant where the affidavit simply stated that the informant observed stolen property in defendant's residence and included no information as to when the informant observed the stolen property, what specific items of stolen property the informant observed, or how the informant knew that the property was stolen.

        - Automobile exception to the warrant requirement justified the search and seizure of a moped because probable cause existed to search the moped, the moped was a vehicle, and the moped was mobile at the time it was initially searched; the vehicle exception applied despite relocation of the moped to the police operations center because both probable cause and mobility still obtained at the center.

        - Granting of defendant's motion to suppress charges under
    18.2-248 was appropriate because the Commonwealth failed to prove that defendant's consent was voluntary.

        - Defendant's motion to suppress evidence was denied because the police officers' initial entry and search of defendant's residence in response to an alarm call did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights against warrantless searches, and was justified under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement; as a result, there was no evidence of illegality surrounding the officers' initial entry and search of defendant's residence that would serve to "taint" or otherwise invalidate defendant's later consent to search.

        - Officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that a driver was under the influence of an intoxicant, justifying a traffic stop based on: (1) the officer witnessing a suspected drug transaction involving the occupants of the car; (2) the driver's failure to signal before turning left in violation of

        Probable cause existed to arrest defendant and conduct a search incident to arrest because there were reasonable grounds for law enforcement to believe a confidential informant's statements were true and, therefore, to rely on that information; the information provided was at least partially verified by another law-enforcement officer, and the informant proved to be reliable because he accurately predicted defendant would be at the designated area and could arrive in a red moped.

        - Defendant's motion to suppress marijuana found in his car at a traffic check-point was granted as there was no protocol for the use of a drug dog, thereby giving the officers at the scene unbridled discretion as to which citizens would be subject to a drug dog "search" or "sniff"; thus, the discretion to use or not use and how to use the drug dog was too great to pass constitutional muster.

      <p>
       That no person shall be deprived of his life, liberty, or property without due process of law; that the General Assembly shall not pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts; and that the right to be free from any governmental discrimination upon the basis of religious conviction, race, color, sex, or national origin shall not be abridged, except that the mere separation of the sexes shall not be considered discrimination.

      <br/>
      <p>
       That in controversies respecting property, and in suits between man and man, trial by jury is preferable to any other, and ought to be held sacred. The General Assembly may limit the number of jurors for civil cases in courts of record to not less than five.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       That the General Assembly shall pass no law whereby private property, the right to which is fundamental, shall be damaged or taken except for public use. No private property shall be damaged or taken for public use without just compensation to the owner thereof.
    No more private property may be taken than necessary to achieve the stated public use.
    Just compensation shall be no less than the value of the property taken, lost profits and lost access, and damages to the residue caused by the taking. The terms "lost profits" and "lost access" are to be defined by the General Assembly.
    A public service company, public service corporation, or railroad exercises the power of eminent domain for public use when such exercise is for the authorized provision of utility, common carrier, or railroad services. In all other cases, a taking or damaging of private property is not for public use if the primary use is for private gain, private benefit, private enterprise, increasing jobs, increasing tax revenue, or economic development, except for the elimination of a public nuisance existing on the property. The condemnor bears the burden of proving that the use is public, without a presumption that it is.

        - Defendant's conviction for assaulting a police officer in violation of

Since the case had been terminated in the district court once the nolle prosequi order was entered, defendant was not under actual arrest for that charge as required by the preliminary hearing statute,
    19.2-218, and not holding the preliminary hearing was a statutory, not constitutional, matter, which meant that defendant's due process rights under Va. Const., Art. I,

        20-109. - Where the parties executed a spousal support agreement, the subsequently enacted subsection A of
    20-109, which barred support to a former spouse involved in a cohabitation relationship analogous to marriage, did not apply retroactively to the agreement, which did not otherwise bar cohabitation; to apply subsection A of
    20-109 retroactively would have amounted to an unconstitutional impairment on the former wife's vested contractual right pursuant to Va. Const., Art. I,

        - The wife's right to alimony did not depend alone upon the final decree of divorce. Instead, her right arose from a property settlement agreement approved and confirmed by the chancellor in the final divorce decree. Such an agreement created vested property rights in the parties by virtue of the judicial sanction and determination of the court; it was a final adjudication of the property rights of the parties. It could not be abrogated by subsequent legislative action found in the 1972 amendments to
    20-109 and 20-109.1. Thus the 1972 amendment to each of those sections as applied to the property settlement in the instant case violated the impairment of contract clauses of both the federal and state Constitutions to the extent that the amendments were applied to the property agreement entered into prior to the amendments.

The negligent acts of public officials or agents in the carrying on of a public duty or function cannot be regarded as acts of the government itself, nor can it be inferred from either the Constitution or the eminent domain statutes that the State has voluntarily assumed liability for the tortious acts of its officers and agents committed in violation of law.

        - This section merely guarantees to each citizen just compensation for his property taken or damaged for public uses. It does not say how he shall be paid or what shall constitute just compensation. Nor does it guarantee that every citizen shall receive equal benefits from a public improvement. If the market value of the landowner's remaining property has been increased by the improvement, such increase may constitute a part of his just compensation. The property owner is entitled to receive the value of what he has been deprived of, and nothing more. If the market value of his remaining land has been increased more than it has been damaged by the improvement, then manifestly he has suffered no loss. Long v.

    55-248.2 through 55-248.40, is entirely appropriate in an equitable claim, but at odds with the role of the court vis-a-vis the jury in an action at law for damages, such as an action for personal injury; (2) to allow the question of whether a tenant may recover damages for personal injuries to turn on the court's discretion would be inconsistent with the recognized principle of tort law that a plaintiff is entitled to compensation sufficient to make him whole; and (3) the provision allowing a court to enjoin a landlord from continuing an act or omission prohibited by the Act and to award damages in its discretion conforms to the longstanding authority of chancery courts to award damages incident to an award of equitable relief. Isbell v. Commercial Inv. Assocs., 273 Va. 605, 644 S.E.2d 72, 2007 Va. LEXIS 52 (2007).

        - Although the mandate of this section includes the right to receive the amount of damages awarded by a jury after a proper trial, the jury trial guarantee secures no rights other than those that existed at common law and the common law never recognized a right to full recovery in tort. Therefore, a statutory cap on medical malpractice damages does not impinge upon the right to trial by jury. Pulliam v. Coastal Emergency Servs. of Richmond, Inc., 257 Va. 1, 509 S.E.2d 307 (1999).

        - Plaintiff waived her right to have a jury decide factual issues raised in defendant's plea in bar by failing to request a jury, either in writing or orally at the hearing on the plea in bar; accordingly, the court did not deny plaintiff her right to trial by jury when the court granted the plea in bar after conducting an evidentiary hearing without a jury. Absent a jury demand, subsection B of
    8.01-336 authorized the court to hear and rule on the plea in bar. Painter v. Singh, 73 Va. Cir. 77, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 32 (Fairfax County 2007).

        In a lessor's breach of contract action, and under a knowing and voluntary waiver test, a lessee waived its right to a jury trial under Va. Const., Art. 1,

The jury waiver provision in the lease was valid, and the fact that the lessee's representative failed to read the lease was irrelevant in the absence of fraud, duress, mutual mistake or lack of capacity or an allegation that the provision was hidden in particularly inconspicuous print.

        Waiver of a jury trial in a lease provision was enforced because a party could waive by contract any right conferred by law or contract if the party being charged with relinquishment of a right had knowledge of the right and intended to waive it; it was clear from the "waiver clause" that was included in the lease that the parties intended to waive jury trial.

       </p>
       <p>
        Since fraud in the inducement was not being claimed to the specific clause in the lease that dealt with the waiver of jury trial, the waiver clause was separable from the contract in which it was embedded; therefore, a lessee's motion to strike the lessors' demand for a jury trial was granted.

       </p>
       <p>
        Lessee's motion to strike lessors' demand for a jury trial was granted because conversion and unjust enrichment claims arose from the landlord-tenant relationship and were included in the language in the waiver that stated that a trial by jury was waived in any action, claim, or counterclaim brought in connection with any matter arising out of or in any way connected with this lease, the landlord-tenant relationship.

        - Virginia Medical Malpractice Act,
    8.01-581.1 et seq., which provided a statutory cap on the amount of damages that could be awarded in a medical malpractice, was constitutional since the law applied equally to all persons within the class because the classification was reasonable and because the medical malpractice cap was a rational means of achieving the legislative goal of securing health care services by maintaining the availability of malpractice insurance at affordable rates.

        Proposed amendment, if adopted, would not expand the meaning of "damages" to such an extent that it would enable the owners of property located in the vicinity of, or affected by, an unpopular public facility to recover damages when none of their land has been taken for the facility.

        Design and construction of highways and roads, including the installation of medians and other traffic management and safety features, represent the exercise of the Commonwealth's police power, the exercise of which generally is not compensable under the current Constitution, provided that a reasonable means of ingress and egress for an abutting property remains; whether limitations on vehicular access will be compensable under the proposed amendment will depend on how the General Assembly defines by statute "lost access" and "lost profits," but a property owner likely will have an opportunity to present to the body determining just compensation evidence of the damages alleged to have been sustained.

        Unless a "suspect classification" is involved, the legislature may, constitutionally, treat different subjects differently for the purpose of taxation: (1) if the difference is real; (2) if the distinction has some relevance to the legislative purpose; and (3) if the differing treatments are not so disparate, relative to the difference in classification, as to be wholly arbitrary. The holding in

        - The Virginia General Assembly may or may not have the authority to mandate that the Virginia National Guard continue the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy after its recent repeal by Congress, but the federal regulations governing the repeal have not yet been issued. The United States Constitution expressly reserves to the states the power to appoint officers to the state militias, including the National Guard. The power to determine which state guard officers are eligible for service in the overlapping National Guard of the United States, however, rests with Congress. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Bill Janis, Member, House of Delegates, 11-001, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 6 (01/25/11).

         "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" in the Virginia National Guard.

       </p>
       <p>
        Congress, through the spending power, can condition the use of federal funds on the States' acceptance of the federal repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." Should the General Assembly wish to avoid the conditions likely to be attached to these funds with respect to "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and mandate that the policy continue in the Virginia National Guard, it can raise, equip and fund an independent Virginia militia entirely from state revenues. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Bill Janis, Member, House of Delegates, 11-001, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 6 (01/25/11).

        - Under current law, a university lawfully may promulgate a policy that prohibits persons from openly carrying a firearm in the buildings that are subject to the policy. However, where a university adopted a policy rather than a regulation, it has not "otherwise prohibited by law" persons with a concealed carry permit from possessing a handgun, and, therefore, the policies may not be used to prohibit persons with such a permit from carrying a concealed firearm into the buildings covered by the policy. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Emmett W. Hanger, Jr., Member, Senate of Virginia, 11-078, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 54 (7/1/11).

        - Va. Const., Art. I,
    14, was within the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of Virginia, and the second portion of Va. Const., Art. I,
    14 was stated in the negative, prohibiting any government "separate from, or independent of, the government of Virginia"; that prohibition did not require further legislation to make it operative. Therefore, Va. Const., Art. I,
    14, was self-executing and George Mason University did not have sovereign immunity as to claims arising under that provision. Digiacinto v. Rector & Visitors of George Mason Univ., 281 Va. 127, 704 S.E.2d 365, 2011 Va. LEXIS 29 (2011).

       That no free government, nor the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people, but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue; by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles; and by the recognition by all citizens that they have duties as well as rights, and that such rights cannot be enjoyed save in a society where law is respected and due process is observed.

        - Case was only about the registration of custody and visitation orders from another state under the provisions of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act and Virginia law and as the custody orders were made consistently with the provisions of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, Virginia must extend full faith and credit to the custody orders; as neither party was asking the court to recognize the relationship of the biological father and the father named on the birth certificate as a valid marriage in the Commonwealth and the custody orders did not arise from fathers' relationship being treated as a marriage, the Defense of Marriage Act, 28 U.S.C.S.
    1738C, was inapplicable. The named father's custodial and visitation rights arose, not out of his relationship with the biological father, but out of his relationship with the child; accordingly, the mother's arguments regarding the Virginia's Marriage Amendment, Va. Const., Art. I,
    15A, and the Marriage Affirmation Act,
    20-45.3, failed. Prashad v. Copeland, 55 Va. App. 247, 685 S.E.2d 199, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 525 (2009).

        - Virginia's exemption of religiously affiliated child care centers from state licensing requirements is constitutional. Forest Hills Early Learning Ctr., Inc. v. Grace Baptist Church, 846 F.2d 260 (4th Cir. 1988), cert. denied sub nom. Forest Hills Early Learning Center, Inc. v. Jackson, 488 U.S. 1029, 102 L. Ed. 2d 969, 109 S. Ct. 837 (1989).

        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        A law is not unconstitutional simply because it
    allows
    churches to advance religion, which is their very purpose; for a law to have forbidden effects, it must be fair to say that the
    government itself
    has advanced religion through its own activities and influence.
    Virginia, in exempting religious child care centers from its licensing requirement, cannot be said to be advancing religion through its own activities and influence; on the contrary, the objective observer should perceive this exemption as an accommodation of the exercise of religion rather than as a government endorsement of religion. Forest Hills Early Learning Ctr., Inc. v. Grace Baptist Church, 846 F.2d 260 (4th Cir. 1988), cert. denied sub nom. Forest Hills Early Learning Center, Inc. v. Jackson, 488 U.S. 1029, 102 L.

        - A regulatory statute's singular exemption of religious groups does not render its purpose suspect; where government acts with the
    proper purpose of lifting a regulation that burdens the exercise of religion, there is no need to require that the exemption come packaged with benefits to secular entities.

        - Section 29.1-521 is not religiously neutral; it substantially burdened the free exercise of the defendants' religion, and the Commonwealth failed to prove that application of it to these defendants advanced a compelling state interest or did so in the least restrictive manner.

        The Supreme Court applies a three-pronged test to decide whether a particular statute, as written or as applied, would pass muster under the Establishment of Religion Clause of the Constitution.
    First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion. Habel v. Industrial Dev. Auth., 241 Va. 96, 400 S.E.2d 516 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Governmental aid normally may be thought to have a primary effect of advancing religion when it flows to an institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission.

        Circuit court properly entered an order enforcing a merger agreement between two churches because, even if the trial court erred by issuing a declaratory judgment, it had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate their dispute over the existence of a contract to merge the two churches where there was nothing inherently ecclesiastical about the agreement, and the merging church's pending bankruptcy did not foreclose the trial court's adjudication of the merger contract where the bankruptcy court approved the plan of reorganization submitted by the merging church, and the plan did not encompass the church property and said nothing about the merger agreement.

Under the First Amendment and Va. Const., Art. I,

        - Bond requirement of
    20-26 was unconstitutional; further, the one person requirement was insufficiently narrowly tailored as required by the Equal Protection Clause and thus
    20-26 unconstitutionally discriminated against the members on the basis of their religion. The members were found to have been appropriate individuals to perform wedding ceremonies. In re Dhanoa, 86 Va. Cir. 373, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 18 (Fairfax County Mar. 29, 2013).

        - In determining whether a church was entitled to charitable immunity, the circuit court could determine whether the compensation provided a pastor was either appropriate under the circumstances or inappropriate because it served as a vehicle to distribute wealth rather than in furtherance of a charitable purpose, based upon neutral principles of law, but any issue as to whether the pastor was grossly overcompensated by the church for what he did as compared to others could not be considered as a strict questioning of the fairness of the compensation would violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution as well as Va. Const., Art. I,

      </h3>
      <br/>
      <p>
       In elections by the people, the qualifications of voters shall be as follows: Each voter shall be a citizen of the United States, shall be eighteen years of age, shall fulfill the residence requirements set forth in this section, and shall be registered to vote pursuant to this article. No person who has been convicted of a felony shall be qualified to vote unless his civil rights have been restored by the Governor or other appropriate authority. As prescribed by law, no person adjudicated to be mentally incompetent shall be qualified to vote until his competency has been reestablished.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       The residence requirements shall be that each voter shall be a resident of the Commonwealth and of the precinct where he votes. Residence, for all purposes of qualification to vote, requires both domicile and a place of abode. The General Assembly may provide for persons who are employed overseas, and their spouses and dependents residing with them, and who are qualified to vote except for relinquishing their place of abode in the Commonwealth while overseas, to vote in the Commonwealth subject to conditions and time limits defined by law. The General Assembly may provide for persons who are qualified to vote except for having moved their residence from one precinct to another within the Commonwealth to continue to vote in a former precinct subject to conditions and time limits defined by law. The General Assembly may also provide, in elections for President and Vice President of the United States, alternatives to registration for new residents of the Commonwealth.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       Any person who will be qualified with respect to age to vote at the next general election shall be permitted to register in advance and also to vote in any intervening primary or special election.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>

        - Although individual presented evidence that he owned a house in Springfield, the evidence was unrefuted that he leased the property to others and did not dwell there. The fact that individual listed the Springfield address on his motor vehicle operator's license, paid personal property tax on his automobile to Fairfax County, and was seeking employment in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, did not alter the conclusion that he was not a domiciliary of Fairfax county, because he did not live in that locality with the intent to remain there for an unlimited time. Further, individual did not have a place of abode in Fairfax County. Thus, the trial court did not err in ruling that the registrar properly cancelled individual's voter registration. Sachs v. Horan, 252 Va. 247, 475 S.E.2d 276 (1996).

        - Writ of mandamus was issued ordering state officials to cancel the registration of all felons who had been invalidly registered and to refuse to register anyone whose political rights had been restored because executive orders seeking to restore the political rights of any persons disqualified by the voter-disqualification provision was unconstitutional, and thus, no election official in the Commonwealth had the discretion to enforce them. Howell v. McAuliffe, 292 Va. 320, 788 S.E.2d 706 (2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 657, 2017 U.S. LEXIS 89, 196 L. Ed. 2d 548 (U.S. 2017).

       </p>
       <p>
        Executive Order that sought to restore the political rights of any persons disqualified by the voter-disqualification provision was in violation of that provision and the anti-suspension provision because the Executive Order had the attributes of an ultra vires assertion of the suspending power that had been forbidden by the Virginia Constitution since 1776. Howell v. McAuliffe, 292 Va. 320, 788 S.E.2d 706 (2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 657, 2017 U.S. LEXIS 89, 196 L. Ed. 2d 548 (U.S. 2017).

        - Governor's assertion of "absolute" power to issue an executive order to restore political rights ran afoul of the separation-of-powers principle; the executive order sought not to mitigate the impact of the voter-disqualification rule of law on an individualized basis but to supersede it entirely for an indiscriminately configured class of approximately 206,000 convicted felons, without any regard for their individual circumstances and without any specific request by individuals seeking relief.

In addition the candidate's new residence was furnished with care, the candidate's personal memorabilia were kept in the new residence, the candidate's annual family celebrations were held at the new residence, and the candidate maintained an office at the new residence.

      <p>
       Members of the House of Representatives of the United States and members of the Senate and of the House of Delegates of the General Assembly shall be elected from electoral districts established pursuant to Section 6-A of this Constitution. Every electoral district shall be composed of contiguous and compact territory and shall be so constituted as to give, as nearly as is practicable, representation in proportion to the population of the district. Every electoral district shall be drawn in accordance with the requirements of federal and state laws that address racial and ethnic fairness, including the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, and judicial decisions interpreting such laws. Districts shall provide, where practicable, opportunities for racial and ethnic communities to elect candidates of their choice.

      <p>
       The districts delineated in the decennial reapportionment law shall be implemented for the November general election for the United States House of Representatives, Senate, or House of Delegates, respectively, that is held immediately prior to the expiration of the term being served in the year that the reapportionment law is required to be enacted. A member in office at the time that a decennial redistricting law is enacted shall complete his term of office and shall continue to represent the district from which he was elected for the duration of such term of office so long as he does not move his residence from the district from which he was elected. Any vacancy occurring during such term shall be filled from the same district that elected the member whose vacancy is being filled.

Compactness and contiguity of the territory, community of interests of the people, observance of natural lines, and conformity to historical divisions, such as county lines, for example, are all to be noticed in assaying the justness of an apportionment.

        While ease of travel within a district is a factor to consider when resolving issues of compactness and contiguity, resting the constitutional test of contiguity solely on physical access within the district imposes an artificial requirement which reflects neither the actual need of the residents of the district nor the panoply of factors which must be considered by the general assembly in the design of a district, and short of an intervening land mass totally severing two sections of an electoral district, there is no per se test for the constitutional requirement of contiguity; each district must be examined separately.

       </p>
       <p>
        Under principles applicable to a court's review of the requirement of contiguity and compactness of a voting district, a redistricting plan is entitled to a strong presumption of validity and will be invalidated only if it clearly violates or is plainly repugnant to a constitutional provision, and when the constitutionality of a plan depends on facts, the determination of those facts by the legislature can be set aside if it is clearly erroneous, arbitrary, or wholly unwarranted, but if the evidence offered in support of the facts in issue would lead objective and reasonable persons to reach different conclusions, the legislative determination is considered fairly debatable and such a determination must be upheld by the courts.

        - A judge is not a ministerial officer of the legislative department, but a discretionary officer of the judicial department, and hence when a law authorizes him to act, he must act judicially or not at all. If the General Assembly intends that an act be ministerially performed, they should authorize its performance by a ministerial officer of their own department. Crute v. Davidson, 20 Va. L. Reg. 341 (1941).

        State Supreme Court granted the petition for writ of mandamus filed by the Commonwealth Attorney, as the trial court did not have the discretion to prohibit the Commonwealth Attorney from seeking the death penalty; the Commonwealth Attorney was entitled to seek the death penalty pursuant to statutory law and the trial court erred by exercising an executive function in determining that the Commonwealth Attorney was prohibited from seeking it in defendant's case where defendant was charged with capital murder pursuant to
    18.2-31. In re Horan, 271 Va. 258, 634 S.E.2d 675, 2006 Va. LEXIS 23 (2006).

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it failed to take a matter under advisement and defer disposition because the stated purpose for taking the matter under advisement was irrelevant to defendant's guilt or innocence of the charged offense of felony driving a motor vehicle after having been adjudged a habitual offender, second or subsequent offense, and the trial court had no power of judicial clemency.

        - Acts 1956, Ex. Sess., ch. 34, created a Joint Committee to "investigate and determine the extent and manner in which the laws of the Commonwealth relating to the administration of justice are being administered and . . . specifically direct its attention to the administration and enforcement of those laws relating to champerty, maintenance, barratry, running and capping and other offenses of any other nature relating to the promotion or support of litigation by persons who are not parties thereto." The act did not confer on the committee executive functions in violation of this section. NAACP v.

        The Industrial Development and Revenue Bond Act (now
    15.2-4900 et seq.) is not the delegation of power to a mere administrative agency foreign to the legislative process but to the local governing bodies which are a part of the legislative arm of the State. The legislature has determined that the promotion of industry and the development of trade by industrial authorities are in the public interest. That determination is presumed to be correct.

        Acting under the grant of
    56 of the Constitution of 1902, which contained directions to the General Assembly concerning elections and declaring offices vacant, the legislature empowered circuit judges to fill vacancies on boards of supervisors, regardless of the cause of the vacancy, and it specifically provided that this power could be exercised even though the vacancy was created by the court's own order in redistricting a county. This delegation of the appointive power to judges was held not to conflict with the doctrine of separation of powers found in
    5 and 39 of the Constitution of 1902 [see now this section]. Avens v. Wright, 320 F. Supp. 677 (W.D. Va. 1970).

        General Assembly has the power to determine the original and appellate jurisdiction of Commonwealth courts, and did not violate the separation of powers doctrine by giving the trial courts the power to consider a petition for approval of a request to seek restoration of voting rights as the statute that conferred that power did not give the trial courts the power to actually restore voting rights, but merely allowed the trial court to determine if the petitioner met the requirements necessary to seek restoration of those rights.

    8.01-581.15, which limits the amount of recoverable damages in a medical malpractice action, is viewed as a modification of the common law or as establishing the jurisdiction of the courts in specific cases, it was proper exercise of legislative power. Indeed, were a court to ignore the legislatively-determined remedy and enter an award in excess of the permitted amount, the court would invade the province of the legislature. Etheridge v.

    1, and Art. VI,
    1, that was not dependent on its creation by legislative enactment and thus could not have been limited by statute; accordingly, the circuit court had jurisdiction to revoke the attorney's privilege to practice before that court and thus, did not err in that judgment. The order by its plain terms applied only to the attorney's right to practice before that circuit court because a court's authority in the discipline of attorneys practicing before it was limited to the jurisdictional boundaries of that court and could not extend to other courts beyond that boundary.

        - Va. Const. art. III,
    1 separation of powers doctrine was implicated in a board's suit against a financial advisor because resolution of the controversy required inquiry into the motives of the board's legislative decision making; proof of the element of reasonable reliance was required, and an evaluation of whether the board members relied on the financial advisor's allegedly misleading statements in their discussions concerning bonds required testimonial probing into the basis for the board's vote. However, the board effectively waived the protection of legislative immunity by: (1) declining to assert legislative immunity, (2) voluntarily filing a complaint that, due to the board's burden of proof, involved issues protected by legislative immunity, and (3) making an unequivocal waiver of protection from inquiry into legislative motivation in the text of its complaint.

        - County board of supervisors' decision to deny the application of a developer and property owner for a conditional use permit to build a resort on agriculturally-zoned property was upheld because: (1) the board considered traffic conditions, septic and well concerns, environmental concerns, and the general character of the neighborhood in making their decision, and thus, it was not arbitrary and capricious under a substantive due process analysis; (2) the board's action was legislative, not administrative, in character and therefore was presumed to be valid under separation of powers principles; and (3) the evidence was sharply conflicting, leaving a question that was "fairly debatable."

        - Virginia Division of Child Support Enforcement was ordered to comply with
    63.2-1954 and distribute the proportionate share of arrearage payments made by fathers to purge a civil contempt among all the fathers' families or children, despite the juvenile court's order that payment go only to the parent or guardian for the child who had brought the contempt proceedings; court held that proration requirement did not infringe on the juvenile court's authority to enforce its own child support orders or render it incapable of the efficient discharge of the duties committed to its care.

    1 vesting legislative power in the General Assembly, waived the Commonwealth representatives' claim of sovereign immunity. Although that provision did not contain traditional indicia of self-executing provisions that waived the Commonwealth's sovereign immunity, no additional legislation was needed to make it operative, and the provision thus permitted the county residents to proceed with their claims against the Commonwealth representatives.

        Circuit court rejected the Commonwealth's arguments in support of its motion for nolle prosequi because it would not enter an order that was inconsistent with the provisions of the Virginia Constitution; the Commonwealth argued public policy as the reason to disregard a criminal statute that was fully considered, voted on, and passed by both chambers of the Virginia General Assembly.

No other business shall be considered at a reconvened session. Such reconvened session shall not continue longer than three days unless the session be extended, for a period not exceeding seven additional days, upon the vote of the majority of the members elected to each house. The General Assembly may provide, by a joint resolution approved during a regular or special session by the vote of the majority of the members elected to each house, that it shall reconvene on a date after the sixth Wednesday after adjournment of the regular or special session but no later than the seventh Wednesday after adjournment.

Whether the Governor lawfully can accept such funding in the future by providing the required "assurance" of funding levels in subsequent years depends upon whether such a pledge represents a political commitment by the Governor or a legal pledge purporting to bind the General Assembly.

        Factors for the court to consider in determining whether an individual functions as an alter ego for purposes of Va. Const. art. IV,
    9, include the individual's relationship with the legislator, the individual's identity, and the source or terms of the individual's pay, if any. This list is not exhaustive, and no one factor is determinative. Based on the totality of the circumstances, courts must evaluate function: whether the person is acting as one with the legislator and whether the individual is functioning in a legislative capacity. Edwards v. Vesilind, 292 Va. 510, 790 S.E.2d 469, 2016 Va. LEXIS 125 (2016).

        Provided the legislator has requested the constituent or third party's assistance in the performance of a legislative act, the Speech or Debate Clause privilege applies to that individual as much as to any other alter ego. However, unsolicited communications and acts taken by the constituent or third party on his or her own initiative will not satisfy this test, even when closely connected to legitimate legislative activity. Edwards v. Vesilind, 292 Va. 510, 790 S.E.2d 469, 2016 Va. LEXIS 125 (2016).

        - First factor in determining whether an individual functions as an alter ego for purposes of Va. Const. art. IV,
    9, i.e., the relationship with the legislator, bears both on function and whether the individual was truly acting on behalf of the legislator. A subordinate or employee working on legislative matters, such as a legislative staffer or Division of Legislative Services employee, is likely to perform legislative functions on behalf of the legislator. A constituent with whom the legislator has had only one contact is unlikely to be acting on the legislator's behalf. An individual need not be a legislator's personal staffer to function within the ambit of the Speech or Debate Clause's protections. In all cases, however, the alter ego must function as an extension of the legislator, not on behalf of the interests of others. Edwards v. Vesilind, 292 Va. 510, 790 S.E.2d 469, 2016 Va. LEXIS 125 (2016).

       <p>
        For purposes of determining whether an individual functions as an alter ego for purposes of Va. Const. art. IV,
    9, the individual's identity informs whether he or she is likely to be functioning in the legislative sphere. For example, policy consultants are more likely to be working in the legislative sphere than political or media consultants. A lawyer working for the legislative branch is more likely to be working in the legislative sphere than someone who specializes in information technology. Admittedly, attempts to draw fine lines between policy and politics will in many cases prove to be illusive. Nonetheless, to the extent that particular communications can be considered policy oriented, they are likely to fall within the legislative sphere. Edwards v. Vesilind, 292 Va. 510, 790 S.E.2d 469, 2016 Va. LEXIS 125 (2016).

       <p>
        For purposes of determining whether an individual functions as an alter ego for purposes of Va. Const. art. IV,
    9, the source of an individual's remuneration, if any, may also be relevant to the inquiry to the extent it informs his likely function. The nature of a remuneration agreement may inhibit some individuals from acting on behalf of a legislator. However, it is the individual's function, not the fact or form of employment, that informs whether the individual acts as an alter ego. Edwards v. Vesilind, 292 Va. 510, 790 S.E.2d 469, 2016 Va.

        Although the nature of a consultant's engagement may bear upon whether the communications with the legislator are within the legislative sphere, or purely political and outside the legislative sphere, the form of hire as a consultant, standing alone, is not dispositive in determining whether an individual functions as an alter ego for purposes of Va. Const. art. IV,

        - Under the Constitution of Virginia, a member of the General Assembly holds the legislative privilege regarding communications protected by the Speech or Debate Clause. The privilege may be invoked and waived only by the legislator or legislators who hold the privilege. So long as the communications concern matters protected by the Speech or Debate Clause, legislators' communications with other legislators are cloaked with constitutional legislative privilege. This rule applies both to protect communications between legislators and among legislative committees which, of course, are composed of legislators. Accordingly, legislative privilege belongs to the legislator. Edwards v. Vesilind, 292 Va. 510, 790 S.E.2d 469, 2016 Va. LEXIS 125 (2016).

       </p>
       <p>
        When a non-legislator seeks to invoke the privilege under the Speech or Debate Clause, Va. Const. art. IV,
    9, a court is presented with a threshold question: whether the individual is functioning in a legislative capacity on behalf and at the direction of a member. If so, this non-legislator is acting as an alter ego of the legislator and may, with the legislator's permission, invoke the legislator's privilege. The alter ego's actions on behalf of the legislator are then protected as though they were the legislator's actions. However, where the legislator would not be protected by the privilege if the act was done by the legislator himself or herself, such as where the act falls outside the scope of legitimate legislative activity, his or her alter ego is likewise unprotected. Edwards v. Vesilind, 292 Va. 510, 790 S.E.2d 469, 2016 Va. LEXIS 125 (2016).

        - Va. Const. art. III,
    1 separation of powers doctrine was implicated in a board's suit against a financial advisor because resolution of the controversy required inquiry into the motives of the board's legislative decision making; proof of the element of reasonable reliance was required, and an evaluation of whether the board members relied on the financial advisor's allegedly misleading statements in their discussions concerning bonds required testimonial probing into the basis for the board's vote. However, the board effectively waived the protection of legislative immunity by: (1) declining to assert legislative immunity, (2) voluntarily filing a complaint that, due to the board's burden of proof, involved issues protected by legislative immunity, and (3) making an unequivocal waiver of protection from inquiry into legislative motivation in the text of its complaint.

Whether the Governor lawfully can accept such funding in the future by providing the required "assurance" of funding levels in subsequent years depends upon whether such a pledge represents a political commitment by the Governor or a legal pledge purporting to bind the General Assembly. The Governor may provide a political pledge to use his best efforts to secure a particular level of funding. The Governor may not, acting on his own, bind the General Assembly to provide future spending. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Robert G.

        was to prevent the members of the legislature and the people from being misled by the title of a law. It was intended to prevent the use of deceptive titles as a cover for vicious legislation, to prevent the practice of bringing together into one bill for corrupt purposes subjects diverse and dissimilar in their nature, and having no necessary connection with each other; and to prevent surprise of fraud in legislation by means of provisions in bills of which the titles gave no intimation. On the other hand, it was not intended to obstruct honest legislation, or to prevent the incorporation into a single act of the entire statutory law upon one general subject. It was not designed to embarrass legislation by compelling the multiplication of laws by the passage of separate acts on a single subject. Commonwealth v.

        "Object" and "subject" are taken to have one and the same signification in constitutional provisions,
       </b>
       <p>
        - The rulings of the courts construing constitutional provisions to the effect that a statute shall embrace no more than one object, which shall be expressed in its title, have impressed the word "object" with a very comprehensive meaning, which repels the contention that the provisions of an act in aid of and related to the purpose expressed in its title are separate objects, and therefore unconstitutional. The body of most general acts contains many provisions in detail, intimately related to the main purpose of the act, but not expressed in the title. Indeed, to incorporate or mention them all in the title would make many titles of intolerable length. City of Richmond v. Pace, 127 Va. 274, 103 S.E. 647 (1920).

        and those things are germane which are allied, relative or appropriate. It is not necessary that the connection, or relationship, of matters in an act shall be logical; it is enough if the matters are connected with and related to a single subject, in popular signification.

        - Although there is more than one subject dealt with in a statute, if the subjects are all congruous, have a natural connection with, are germane to, and are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the one object of the statute, the constitutional provision that no law shall embrace more than one object, which shall be expressed in its title, is satisfied.

        If the subjects embraced by the act, but not specified in the title, have congruity, or natural connection, with the subject stated in the title, or are cognate, or germane, thereto, the requirement of the Constitution "that no law shall embrace more than one object, which shall be expressed in the title," is satisfied.

The act contained no emergency clause, and therefore did not take effect until the lapse of 90 days after the adjournment of the session of the General Assembly at which it was passed. But the board of supervisors could validly adopt and ratify the act before the same actually took effect as a law, there being nothing in the act to indicate any intention on the part of the legislature to require the board to wait until the law would inevitably become effective before signifying approval of its terms.

    No natural person shall have a constitutionally protected property right to bar a cause of action based on intentional torts as described herein on the ground that a change in the accrual date for the action has been applied retroactively or that a statute of limitations or statute of repose has expired.

        equal protection rights are guaranteed by the antidiscrimination clause in Va. Const., Art. I,

    Ransone v. Craft,
    161 Va. 332, 170 S.E. 610 (1933), the Supreme Court said: ". . . It has been repeatedly held by this court that charters of municipal corporations, or amendments thereto, conferring rights and powers different from, and in addition to, those conferred by general statutes are authorized by the Constitution when enacted in accordance with
    40 through 68 [Va. Const., Art. IV,
    1 through 9] and
    117 [Va. Const., Art. VII,

        - In Virginia it is an accepted doctrine that neither law nor equity courts have any inherent power to confer divorces. Consequently this section directed the legislature to confer power upon the courts to grant divorces. In obedience to the mandate of this section,

        - Circuit court rejected the Commonwealth's arguments in support of its motion for nolle prosequi because it would not enter an order that was inconsistent with the provisions of the Virginia Constitution; the Commonwealth argued public policy as the reason to disregard a criminal statute that was fully considered, voted on, and passed by both chambers of the Virginia General Assembly.

        - Although the imposition of different taxes on transactions in different localities does not violate Article X,
    1, Acts 2013, c. 766's imposition of taxes in the specific localities constitutes a local law related to taxation prohibited by Article IV,
    14(5) of the Virginia Constitution. Because the taxes were imposed directly by the General Assembly, the taxes cannot be saved by the provisions of Article VII,

        - Because the enforcement of the existing restrictive covenants in the deeds pertaining to a statue of a Confederate general of the Civil War were contrary to the then public policy, as established by enactments of the Virginia General Assembly, the removal of the monument by executive action was not prohibited. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the presumptively constitutional enactments were not rationally related to the then legislative desire to remove the monument. Taylor v. Northam,, 2020 Va.

        - Whether to fund religious studies along with other post-secondary education lies within a permissible zone of accommodation of religion but is not mandatory. A choice not to fund out-of-state studies at church-affiliated institutions would therefore not offend the establishment clause of the federal Constitution. Phan v.

      <p>
       The Governor shall be elected by the qualified voters of the Commonwealth at the time and place of choosing members of the General Assembly. Returns of the election shall be transmitted, under seal, by the proper officers, to the State Board of Elections, or such other officer or agency as may be designated by law, which shall cause the returns to be opened and the votes to be counted in the manner prescribed by law. The person having the highest number of votes shall be declared elected; but if two or more shall have the highest and an equal number of votes, one of them shall be chosen Governor by a majority of the total membership of the General Assembly. Contested elections for Governor shall be decided by a like vote. The mode of proceeding in such cases shall be prescribed by law.

        - The veto power of the executive is designed to prevent the evils that flow from arbitrary or ill-considered legislation. Gill v. Nickels, 197 Va. 123, 87 S.E.2d 806 (1955).

       <b>
        Constitutional provisions regulating the exercise of the power are mandatory
       </b>
       <p>
        - The limitation in this section that the Governor's veto shall not affect the item or items to which he does not object cuts down the items which may be vetoed but does not change or qualify its effect. An appropriation bill with an unconditional approval, together with valid vetoes, becomes a valid statute. Commonwealth v. Dodson, 176 Va. 281, 11 S.E.2d 120 (1940).
       </p>
       <br/>
       <b>
        Effect of veto of particular items in appropriation bill.
       </b>
       <p>
        - The power to veto items in an appropriation bill does not carry with it power to strike out conditions or restrictions, for that would be legislation. Commonwealth v. Dodson, 176 Va. 281, 11 S.E.2d 120 (1940).
        <b>
         No power to strike out conditions or restrictions.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a condition is attached to an appropriation, the condition must be observed. The Governor cannot veto the appropriation without also disapproving the condition; correspondingly, he cannot veto the condition without also disapproving the appropriation. Brault v. Holleman, 217 Va. 441, 230 S.E.2d 238 (1976).
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p>
        - While the Governor is empowered to veto any particular item or items of an appropriation bill, he must, for his veto to be valid, strike down the whole of an item; he cannot disapprove part of an item and approve the remainder. And this rule prevents the Governor from reducing the amount of an appropriation which by itself constitutes an item. Brault v. Holleman, 217 Va. 441, 230 S.E.2d 238 (1976).

        and is but an idle gesture. The item vetoed was in fact never stricken out and the veto does not invalidate the bill as a whole where it was otherwise unconditionally approved. Commonwealth v. Dodson, 176 Va. 281, 11 S.E.2d 120 (1940).
       </p>
       <br/>
       <b>
        An unconstitutional veto of an item in an appropriation bill is no veto at all
       </b>
       <p>
        - "Item" as used in this section, refers to something which may be taken out of an appropriation bill without affecting its other purposes or provisions. It is something which can be lifted bodily from it rather than cut out. Commonwealth v. Dodson, 176 Va. 281, 11 S.E.2d 120 (1940).
        <b>
         Meaning of "item."
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        An item in an appropriation bill is an indivisible sum of money dedicated to a stated purpose. It is something different from a provision or condition, and where conditions are attached, they must be observed; where none are attached, none may be added. Commonwealth v. Dodson, 176 Va. 281, 11 S.E.2d 120 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        The creation of a new office, its holder to serve at a stated salary, without more, would be an "item" which the Governor at his election might veto, but if it be tied up with other budget provisions, then under the terms of the Constitution it cannot be eliminated. Commonwealth v. Dodson, 176 Va. 281, 11 S.E.2d 120 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the constitutional sense, an item of an appropriation bill is an indivisible sum of money dedicated to a stated purpose; the term refers to something which may be eliminated from the bill without affecting the enactment's other purposes or provisions. Brault v. Holleman, 217 Va. 441, 230 S.E.2d 238 (1976).
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p>
        - The "tying up" of purposes so as to preclude characterization of one of multiple appropriations for a single purpose as a single "item" must be more than incidental; the relationship between purposes must appear intrinsically, rather than extrinsically. The real question, therefore, is whether, from the terms of the appropriation bill itself, several appropriations relating to the same subject are so legally "tied up," are made so legally interdependent, that one cannot be eliminated from the enactment without affecting its other purposes or provisions. If it is clear from the appropriation bill that, with the disapproved provision eliminated, the approved appropriations cannot effectively serve their intended purposes, the attempted elimination is invalid. Brault v. Holleman, 217 Va. 441, 230 S.E.2d 238 (1976).

       <p>
        - Enrolled House Bill 29, which set out additional appropriations for the 1994-96 biennium, was the same bill enacted by the General Assembly, the bill was published "at length" within the meaning of Article IV, Section 12 of the state Constitution, and the bill did not impair the Governor's item veto power or his ability to ensure that expenses for the biennium did not exceed revenues. Gilmore v. Landsidle, 252 Va. 388, 478 S.E.2d 307 (1996).

      </h3>
      <br/>
      <p>
       When the Governor-elect is disqualified, resigns, or dies following his election but prior to taking office, the Lieutenant Governor-elect shall succeed to the office of Governor for the full term. When the Governor-elect fails to assume office for any other reason, the Lieutenant Governor-elect shall serve as Acting Governor.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       Whenever the Governor transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Delegates his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Lieutenant Governor as Acting Governor.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       Whenever the Attorney General, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Delegates, or a majority of the total membership of the General Assembly, transmit to the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Delegates their written declaration that the Governor is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Lieutenant Governor shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting Governor.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       Thereafter, when the Governor transmits to the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Delegates his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Attorney General, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Delegates, or a majority of the total membership of the General Assembly, transmit within four days to the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Delegates their written declaration that the Governor is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon the General Assembly shall decide the issue, convening within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not already in session. If within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter declaration or, if the General Assembly is not in session, within twenty-one days after the General Assembly is required to convene, the General Assembly determines by three-fourths vote of the elected membership of each house of the General Assembly that the Governor is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Lieutenant Governor shall become Governor; otherwise, the Governor shall resume the powers and duties of his office.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       In the case of the removal of the Governor from office or in the case of his disqualification, death, or resignation, the Lieutenant Governor shall become Governor.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       If a vacancy exists in the office of Lieutenant Governor when the Lieutenant Governor is to succeed to the office of Governor or to serve as Acting Governor, the Attorney General, if he is eligible to serve as Governor, shall succeed to the office of Governor for the unexpired term or serve as Acting Governor. If the Attorney General is ineligible to serve as Governor, the Speaker of the House of Delegates, if he is eligible to serve as Governor, shall succeed to the office of Governor for the unexpired term or serve as Acting Governor. If a vacancy exists in the office of the Speaker of the House of Delegates or if the Speaker of the House of Delegates is ineligible to serve as Governor, the House of Delegates shall convene and fill the vacancy.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       In the event of an emergency or enemy attack upon the soil of Virginia and a resulting inability of the House of Delegates to convene to fill the vacancy, the Speaker of the House, the person designated to act in his stead as prescribed in the Rules of the House of Delegates, the President pro tempore of the Senate, or the majority leader of the Senate, in that designated order, shall serve as Acting Governor until such time as the House of Delegates convenes to elect a Governor.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       The General Assembly may provide by law for the waiver of the eligibility requirements for the Attorney General, Speaker of the House, or acting Speaker to serve as Governor or Acting Governor in the event of an emergency or enemy attack upon the soil of Virginia as evidenced by a proclamation of the Governor or alternative authority prescribed by law.

       The judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Supreme Court and in such other courts of original or appellate jurisdiction subordinate to the Supreme Court as the General Assembly may from time to time establish.

      <p>
       The Supreme Court shall, by virtue of this Constitution, have original jurisdiction in cases of habeas corpus, mandamus, and prohibition; to consider claims of actual innocence presented by convicted felons in such cases and in such manner as may be provided by the General Assembly; in matters of judicial censure, retirement, and removal under Section 10 of this Article; and to answer questions of state law certified by a court of the United States or the highest appellate court of any other state. All other jurisdiction of the Supreme Court shall be appellate. Subject to such reasonable rules as may be prescribed as to the course of appeals and other procedural matters, the Supreme Court shall, by virtue of this Constitution, have appellate jurisdiction in cases involving the constitutionality of a law under this Constitution or the Constitution of the United States and in cases involving the life or liberty of any person.

        - This section has conferred upon the General Assembly the power to determine the original and appellate jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth, and where the jurisdiction conferred upon the courts by statute does not go to the limits of due process, the courts of the Commonwealth may not go further and assert jurisdiction over persons over not embraced within that legislation.

        General Assembly has the power to determine the original and appellate jurisdiction of Commonwealth courts, and did not violate the separation of powers doctrine by giving the trial courts the power to consider a petition for approval of a request to seek restoration of voting rights, because the statute did not give the trial courts the power to actually restore voting rights, but merely allowed the trial court to determine if the petitioner met the requirements necessary to seek restoration of those rights.

        - It is not disputed that the Constitution contains the familiar separation of the powers of government between the legislative, executive and judicial branches. The Supreme Court is provided for in the Constitution. The composition and jurisdiction of the Court are outlined, with nothing to indicate that its functions and jurisdiction generally are other than judicial, as distinct from legislative.

        - Under the present constitution, which became effective July 1, 1971, the rule in Virginia is that exemption of property from taxation shall be strictly construed and, under this rule, exemption from taxation is the exception, and where there is any doubt, the doubt is resolved against the one claiming exemption and the housing and health care facility came into existence and acquired its property after July 1, 1971. Hence, its claim to exemption must have been strictly construed, and this meant that entitlement to exemption must have appeared clearly from the statutory provisions upon which it relies.

        - Since the trial court found that the evidence proved the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, it was correct in holding that it did not have the authority to acquit defendant and convict him of some other crime; the trial court had not yet entered a written conviction order, and thus, it had inherent authority to defer disposition and continue the case even after it accepted defendant's guilty plea on the record.

        - The inherent power of the Supreme Court to suspend or annul the license of an attorney practicing before it is not abridged by this section limiting the original jurisdiction of the Court to cases of habeas corpus, mandamus and prohibition. Such power does not depend for its existence upon either constitutional or statutory provisions, but is possessed by all courts of record, unless taken away by express constitutional (or possibly legislative) inhibition.

        - Authority of a court to regulate the conduct of attorneys practicing before that court by revoking or suspending that privilege was both an inherent and a constitutional power under Va. Const., Art. III,
    1, and Art. VI,
    1, that was not dependent on its creation by legislative enactment and thus could not have been limited by statute; accordingly, the circuit court had jurisdiction to revoke the attorney's privilege to practice before that court and thus, did not err in that judgment. The order by its plain terms applied only to the attorney's right to practice before that circuit court because a court's authority in the discipline of attorneys practicing before it was limited to the jurisdictional boundaries of that court and could not extend to other courts beyond that boundary.

        - The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is provided by this section. With respect to such jurisdiction, however, this section is not self-executing but merely bestows upon the Supreme Court the capacity to receive appellate jurisdiction. The jurisdiction is received when conferred by the legislature. Former
    19.1-282 (now
    19.2-317) is executory of this section and confers upon the Supreme Court the appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases called for by the Constitution. That is all the Code section pretends to do. The provision in former
    19.1-282 that a writ of error shall lie in any criminal case for the accused grants only the right to seek to invoke such appellate jurisdiction and does not mean that the jurisdiction may be invoked in every case. Nor, when the nature and effect of a plea of guilty are considered, does it mean that an accused who enters a plea of guilty does not waive his right to seek to invoke such jurisdiction. Peyton v. King, 210 Va. 194, 169 S.E.2d 569 (1969).

If the court were to consider and uphold the Attorney General's assignment of cross-error, defendant would lose the opportunity for acquittal in the new trial afforded him by the en banc judgment of the Court of Appeals. Such a case was one "involving the life or liberty of a person." Campbell v. Commonwealth, 246 Va. 174, 431 S.E.2d 648 (1993).

No decision shall become the judgment of the Court, however, except on the concurrence of at least three justices, and no law shall be declared unconstitutional under either this Constitution or the Constitution of the United States except on the concurrence of at least a majority of all justices of the Supreme Court.

        § 10. Disabled and unfit judges.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <br/>
      <p>
       The General Assembly shall create a Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission consisting of members of the judiciary, the bar, and the public and vested with the power to investigate charges which would be the basis for retirement, censure, or removal of a judge. The Commission shall be authorized to conduct hearings and to subpoena witnesses and documents. Proceedings and documents before the Commission may be confidential as provided by the General Assembly in general law.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       If the Commission finds the charges to be well-founded, it may file a formal complaint before the Supreme Court.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       Upon the filing of a complaint, the Supreme Court shall conduct a hearing in open court and, upon a finding of disability which is or is likely to be permanent and which seriously interferes with the performance by the judge of his duties, shall retire the judge from office. A judge retired under this authority shall be considered for the purpose of retirement benefits to have retired voluntarily.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       If the Supreme Court after the hearing on the complaint finds that the judge has engaged in misconduct while in office, or that he has persistently failed to perform the duties of his office, or that he has engaged in conduct prejudicial to the proper administration of justice, it shall censure him or shall remove him from office. A judge removed under this authority shall not be entitled to retirement benefits, but only to the return of contributions made by him, together with any income accrued thereon.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       This section shall apply to justices of the Supreme Court, to judges of other courts of record, and to members of the State Corporation Commission. The General Assembly also may provide by general law for the retirement, censure, or removal of judges of any court not of record, or other personnel exercising judicial functions.

        The provision that judges removed from office shall lose their pension is not an incidental or collateral consequence
       </b>
       <p>
        - The federal district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a suit to enjoin the removal of a general district court judge and his wife from the rolls of the Virginia Retirement System following his removal from office since such a suit would require a review of the judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court removing the judge from office and a relitigation of federal questions decided in the state court. The proper forum for federal review was the United States Supreme Court on appeal or by writ of certiorari. Maurice v. Board of Dirs., 450 F. Supp. 755 (E.D. Va. 1977).

         Federal review.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, federal district courts lack jurisdiction to hear federal constitutional claims that are judicial in nature and have been adjudicated by state courts or that are inextricably intertwined with the merits of a state court judgment. It is unquestionable that the investigation of charges by the Judicial Investigations and Review Committee (JIRC) are proceedings which are essentially judicial in nature. Edmonds v. Clarkson, 996 F. Supp. 541 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 165 F.3d 910 (4th Cir. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claims that fall within the ambit of the "inextricably intertwined" construction of the preclusive principles of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine include federal constitutional claims which could have been brought in the state proceedings but were not. Therefore, the federal district court was without subject matter jurisdiction to review an action filed by a former state court judge, whose claims were based on constitutional questions which were part and parcel of the issues pending in, or which could have been raised in, the Judicial Investigations and Review Committee (JIRC) proceedings that were underway when the former judge chose to resign his position, rather than defend against the charges he was facing. Edmonds v. Clarkson, 996 F. Supp. 541 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 165 F.3d 910 (4th Cir. 1998).

         Review of Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission findings.

       <p>
        In a case brought by the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission pursuant to Va. Const., Art. VI,
    10 and
    17.1-902, citing to
    17.1-913, the judge unsuccessfully argued that it was improper for the Commission to admit and consider evidence of her prior contacts with the Commission; she contended that neither
    17.1-913 nor VA. Jud. Inq. and Rev. R. 16 allowed for the removal of the confidentiality of records of complaints that were not deemed well founded and that her two prior contacts were not determined to be well founded. At the outset of the Commission hearing, counsel for the Commission stated that the exhibits were all in the red binder there on the witness desk and that both the sides were in agreement that there was no objection to the admission of any of the exhibits; pursuant to Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5:25, the judge's agreement to the Commission's admission of the exhibits was fatal to her argument that the Commission erred in admitting those same exhibits. Judicial Inquiry & Review Comm'n of Va. v. Taylor, 278 Va. 699, 685 S.E.2d 51, 2009 Va. LEXIS 114 (2009), cert. denied, 177 L. Ed. 2d 304, 130 S. Ct. 3396, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 4645 (2010).

        In a case brought pursuant to Va. Const., Art. VI,
    10 and
    17.1-902, the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission proved by clear and convincing evidence that a judge violated Canons of Judicial Conduct 1, 2A, and 3B(2) when she ruled that her order denying a juvenile's written motion for bond and release pending the sentencing hearing was interlocutory and nonappealable. The judge could not prevent the appeal of her decision by ruling that the order was interlocutory and nonappealable; the judge's violations of Canons 1, 2A, and 3B(2) constituted conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.

        - Despite the claims of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission that it had a right to file a complaint in the Supreme Court of Virginia against a district judge, seeking his censure or removal because of his judicial conduct, that Court determined that under Va. Const., Art. VI,
    10, and
    17.1-902, the complaint should not have been filed. The judge and the Commission had reached a valid supervision agreement under Va. Jud. Inq. and Rev. R. 15(A)(4), in which the judge's return to the bench was conditioned, in part, on certain terms, but the Commission indicated that immediately after the hearing, he could tell people that he was returning to the bench; the judge thus did not violate the terms, and the Commission, in the absence of a breach by the judge, was bound by the agreement and foreclosed from revoking it and filing a complaint in the Supreme Court pursuant to Va. Jud. Inq. and Rev. R. 15(A)(2). Judicial Inquiry & Review Comm'n of Va. v. Elliott, 272 Va. 97, 630 S.E.2d 485, 2006 Va. LEXIS 58 (2006).

Const., Art. VI,
    10, and
    17.1-902. While the judge accepted the Commission's terms in writing, the agreement was not in writing, nothing required it to be in writing, and a valid supervision agreement had been reached; the Commission's concerns that it would not sign an agreement until its chairman and members had approved the document reflected concerns of form rather than substance, and the Court was not inclined to place form over substance.

       The General Assembly shall provide by general law for the organization, government, powers, change of boundaries, consolidation, and dissolution of counties, cities, towns, and regional governments. The General Assembly may also provide by general law optional plans of government for counties, cities, or towns to be effective if approved by a majority vote of the qualified voters voting on any such plan in any such county, city, or town.

      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       Every law providing for the organization of a regional government shall, in addition to any other requirements imposed by the General Assembly, require the approval of the organization of the regional government by a majority vote of the qualified voters voting thereon in each county and city which is to participate in the regional government and of the voters voting thereon in a part of a county or city where only the part is to participate.

        - Under general statute law the trial courts, in passing upon the questions relative to the annexation of territory to a municipal corporation, exercise a power formerly exercised by the legislature itself by the passing or refusing to pass special statutes for the enlargement of the limits of cities and towns. Hence the trial courts in such cases exercise a constitutionally delegated power, which, although mainly judicial, and not without limits, is to some extent quasi legislative and political in its character.

        - The enactors of our organic law must necessarily have understood and contemplated that the annexation of territory from a county to a city and vice versa would, in many, if not every case, take into the city or county limits more or less inhabitants of the territory annexed and operate upon their municipal relations.

       <p>
        A sheriff is a constitutional officer. His duties are defined by statute, and, with certain exceptions, the law imposes upon him the mandatory duty of service of process. For a failure to execute a process issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction without legal excuse, the law imposes penalties. Narrows Grocery Co. v. Bailey, 161 Va. 278, 170 S.E. 730 (1933); Whited v. Fields, 581 F. Supp. 1444 (W.D. Va. 1984).

        Because a sheriff is a state officer, a county cannot be held liable for his actions. Keathley v. Vitale, 866 F. Supp. 272 (E.D. Va. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The sheriff and sheriff's department are arms of the Commonwealth and they, therefore, are entitled to invoke the defense of immunity from suit pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Blankenship v. Warren County, 918 F. Supp. 970 (W.D. Va.), modified, 931 F. Supp. 447 (W.D. Va. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if a successor sheriff was legally independent of her predecessor under Va. Const., Art. VII,
    4, the Supremacy Clause did not allow state law to override Title VII employer liability, thus, defendant new sheriff was properly substituted as defendant on the official capacity claim against defendant old sheriff under Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d) on plaintiff deputy's sexual harassment claim. King v. McMillan, 594 F.3d 301, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 2308 (4th Cir. 2010).

        Where contractors working at a jail were required to undergo a strip search and had their security clearances revoked after filing suit, Eleventh Amendment immunity barred their official capacity claims seeking monetary damages because sheriffs were state officers.

       <p>
        Circuit court did not err in sustaining a sheriff's demurrer to an investigator's action for retaliatory termination because, while constitutional officers, including sheriffs, could perform certain functions in conjunction with local government, they were creations of the state constitution, their offices and powers existed independent from the local government, and the investigator, as a sheriff's deputy, was an employee of the sheriff and was not a local employee.

        - As a constitutional officer, the sheriff serves independent of the municipal or county government and independent of the state government. Clearly, then, neither a city nor the State is responsible for the actions of a sheriff's department, nor does the city or the State have any control over the actions of the sheriff. Sherman v. City of Richmond, 543 F. Supp. 447 (E.D. Va. 1982).

This power is absolute because no limitation is imposed upon it. Consequently the municipality may impose any condition it chooses upon its consent aforesaid, however unreasonable. It results from this that such power includes the power in municipalities to make a stipulation as to what the rate charges of the utility corporation shall be during the whole franchise period, as a condition upon which the consent is given.

    8 and 9 together, the authors of the Constitution of Virginia intended that a municipality have the power to grant or deny a franchise to a public utility, but that a municipality, having once granted a franchise, is impressed with a duty to ensure uninterrupted utility service to the consuming public. Such a duty requires a municipality to make plans for service following termination and to do so in time to implement the plan it selects before the franchise expires. Potomac Edison Co. v. Town of Luray, 234 Va. 348, 362 S.E.2d 678 (1987).

Before granting any such franchise or privilege for a term in excess of five years, except for a trunk railway, the city or town shall, after due advertisement, publicly receive bids therefor. Such grant, and any contract in pursuance thereof, may provide that upon the termination of the grant, the plant as well as the property, if any, of the grantee in the streets, avenues, and other public places shall thereupon, without compensation to the grantee, or upon the payment of a fair valuation therefor, become the property of the said city or town; but the grantee shall be entitled to no payment by reason of the value of the franchise.

        - It should not be presumed, from such language as that used in this section, that the State thereby intended to surrender the police power. Clearer language than this is needed to indicate that the State has abdicated or renounced to the municipalities its legislative power to regulate rates. Indeed, the language of that very section again emphasizes the undeviating purpose of the State to insist that such rates, whether established by contract or otherwise, shall at all times be reasonable. City of Richmond v. Virginia Ry. & Power Co., 141 Va. 69, 126 S.E. 353 (1925).
        <b>
         The State by this section did not surrender to the municipalities unlimited power to contract as to rates.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The use of the word "reasonable" in this section negatives the idea that it was intended to confer unlimited contractual power upon the municipality, and clearly implies the reservation of the supervisory and regulative power of the State, which is otherwise and elsewhere so clearly and repeatedly expressed in the Constitution. That this section is thus construed by the General Assembly is apparent from
    56-40, 56-232 through 56-253 and 56-481. Town of Victoria v. Victoria Ice, Light & Power Co., 134 Va. 134, 114 S.E. 92 (1922).

        - Construing Va. Const., Art. VII,
    8 and 9 together, the authors of the Constitution of Virginia intended that a municipality have the power to grant or deny a franchise to a public utility, but that a municipality, having once granted a franchise, is impressed with a duty to ensure uninterrupted utility service to the consuming public. Such a duty requires a municipality to make plans for service following termination and to do so in time to implement the plan it selects before the franchise expires. Potomac Edison Co. v. Town of Luray, 234 Va. 348, 362 S.E.2d 678 (1987).

        Factual findings of a municipal legislative body in terminating a franchise
       </b>
       <p>
        - In a proceeding to revoke a franchise, where evidence of unreasonableness is met with evidence of reasonableness, a classic case of a "fairly debatable" issue is presented. Under these circumstances, it is the legislative body, and not the court, which has the prerogative to decide the issue. Because the issue is fairly debatable, the legislative judgment must stand. Town of Narrows v. Clear-View Cable TV, Inc., 227 Va. 272, 315 S.E.2d 835, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 925, 105 S. Ct. 315, 83 L. Ed. 2d 253, rehearing denied, 469 U.S. 1143, 105 S. Ct. 826, 83 L.

       </b>
       <p>
        - Upon review of a trial court's determination that a municipality's action in revoking a franchise was arbitrary and capricious, the Supreme Court accords the court's finding, as in the usual case, a presumption of correctness. The court also, however, gives full credit to the presumption of validity of the challenged legislative action and then, considering both presumptions, it examines the record to determine whether the evidence sustains the court's finding. Town of Narrows v. Clear-View Cable TV, Inc., 227 Va. 272, 315 S.E.2d 835, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 925, 105 S. Ct. 315, 83 L. Ed. 2d 253, rehearing denied, 469 U.S. 1143, 105 S. Ct. 826, 83 L.

      </h3>
      <p>
       (a)
    No city or town shall issue any bonds or other interest-bearing obligations which, including existing indebtedness, shall at any time exceed ten per centum of the assessed valuation of the real estate in the city or town subject to taxation, as shown by the last preceding assessment for taxes. In determining the limitation for a city or town there shall not be included the following classes of indebtedness:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) Certificates of indebtedness, revenue bonds, or other obligations issued in anticipation of the collection of the revenues of such city or town for the then current year; provided that such certificates, bonds, or other obligations mature within one year from the date of their issue, be not past due, and do not exceed the revenue for such year.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) Bonds pledging the full faith and credit of such city or town authorized by an ordinance enacted in accordance with Section 7, and approved by the affirmative vote of the qualified voters of the city or town voting upon the question of their issuance, for a supply of water or other specific undertaking from which the city or town may derive a revenue; but from and after a period to be determined by the governing body not exceeding five years from the date of such election, whenever and for so long as such undertaking fails to produce sufficient revenue to pay for cost of operation and administration (including interest on bonds issued therefor), the cost of insurance against loss by injury to persons or property, and an annual amount to be placed into a sinking fund sufficient to pay the bonds at or before maturity, all outstanding bonds issued on account of such undertaking shall be included in determining such limitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) Bonds of a city or town the principal and interest on which are payable exclusively from the revenues and receipts of a water system or other specific undertaking or undertakings from which the city or town may derive a revenue or secured, solely or together with such revenues, by contributions of other units of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       (4) Contract obligations of a city or town to provide payments over a period of more than one year to any publicly owned or controlled regional project, if the project has been authorized by an interstate compact or if the General Assembly by general law or special act has authorized an exclusion for such project purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b)
    No debt shall be contracted by or on behalf of any county or district thereof or by or on behalf of any regional government or district thereof except by authority conferred by the General Assembly by general law. The General Assembly shall not authorize any such debt, except the classes described in paragraphs (1) and (3) of subsection (a), refunding bonds, and bonds issued, with the consent of the school board and the governing body of the county, by or on behalf of a county or district thereof for capital projects for school purposes and sold to the Literary Fund, the Virginia Retirement System, or other State agency prescribed by law, unless in the general law authorizing the same, provision be made for submission to the qualified voters of the county or district thereof or the region or district thereof, as the case may be, for approval or rejection by a majority vote of the qualified voters voting in an election on the question of contracting such debt. Such approval shall be a prerequisite to contracting such debt.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       Any county may, upon approval by the affirmative vote of the qualified voters of the county voting in an election on the question, elect to be treated as a city for the purposes of issuing its bonds under this section. If a county so elects, it shall thereafter be subject to all of the benefits and limitations of this section applicable to cities, but in determining the limitation for a county there shall be included, unless otherwise excluded under this section, indebtedness of any town or district in that county empowered to levy taxes on real estate.

        - The Transportation District Commission is an independent political subdivision in the same manner as are housing authorities, water and sewer authorities, and industrial development authorities. The enabling legislation, like that of these other authorities vested with the power to incur bonded indebtedness, affirms that debt so incurred is that of the entity, not of the Commonwealth or of any other political subdivision. Former
    15.1-1358.2 (a) (2) (see now
    15.2-4519). This statement is repeated in the bonds themselves, as well as in other documents constituting the financing proposal. The debt incurred by legislatively created, independent political subdivisions, whatever their title, is not the debt of the Commonwealth or of any other governmental unit. Therefore, the debt which will be incurred by the Commission in issuing the bonds is not subject to the provisions of subsection (b). Dykes v. Northern Va. Transp. Dist.

        for which the municipality agrees to pay in installments as the service is furnished, does not create a present debt for the aggregate amount of all the installments throughout the term of the contract within the meaning of constitutional limitations of municipal indebtedness.

       </p>
       <p>
        The rule that arises out of the peculiar nature of service contracts saves such contracts from invalidity under this section. This rule recognizes that a commitment for services to be paid for only after the services are rendered is not a commitment for debt or indebtedness within the meaning of constitutional limitations or prohibitions. Rather this commitment is to honor each year the account payable incurred for services rendered that year. Board of Supvrs. v. Massey, 210 Va. 680, 173 S.E.2d 869 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Agreements of Fairfax County and the City of Falls Church to pay in yearly installments for the transit service rendered their residents during those years by the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority do not create a debt or indebtedness within the meaning of this section. Board of Supvrs. v. Massey, 210 Va. 680, 173 S.E.2d 869 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contracts obligating a local government to pay for continuing services only after the services are rendered do not constitute a commitment for debt within the meaning of the Constitution. Even though such contracts may extend over a period of years, they are construed only as commitments to honor each year the account payable incurred for services rendered that year. On the other hand, if a local government contracts an unconditional debt, it cannot avoid the constitutional debt clause by agreeing to repay it in annual installments. The distinction depends upon whether the local government is unconditionally liable for the whole debt, even though payment is postponed, or whether its obligation to pay only arises after it has received, within each year, the service contracted for that year. Fairfax-Falls Church Community Servs. Bd. v. Herren, 230 Va. 390, 337 S.E.2d 741 (1985).
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p>
        - The attributes of continuing-services contracts which cause them to fall outside the debt clause also preclude the application of the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation. To survive the debt prohibition, such contracts must be severable into annual segments. Within each annual segment, they must be essentially unilateral. There is no cause of action for the anticipatory repudiation of such contracts. Fairfax-Falls Church Community Servs. Bd. v. Herren, 230 Va. 390, 337 S.E.2d 741 (1985).

        Bonds approved by the voters of Prince William County and bonds approved by the voters of the City of Virginia Beach at a time when the Public Finance Act (see now
    15.2-2600 et seq.) provided a maximum interest rate of six percent cannot subsequently be issued at an interest rate of seven percent although the General Assembly determined that a fiscal emergency existed and enacted a law (former
    2.1-326.1 through 2.1-326.3 - see now
    2.2-5000 through 2.2-5003) authorizing counties and cities to issue bonds at higher interest rates. The rate of interest to be paid on the bonds was part of the "submission to the voters" and the issuance of bonds pursuant to an election must be in conformity with the terms and conditions of the submission. The terms of a bond cannot be changed so as to materially increase the burden on the voter after a vote that is constitutionally required. It was beyond the power of the General Assembly to authorize a higher interest rate on the bonds. Miller v. Ayres, 211 Va. 69, 175 S.E.2d 253 (1970).

    15.2-4908 to 15.2-4911) of the Industrial Development and Revenue Bond Act create a "special fund" providing the only means for payment of the bonds issued by an industrial development authority. That fund is to be made up solely of the revenues and receipts derived from the lease or sale by the authority of its properties. It is clear that under such an arrangement the city does not, either directly or indirectly, issue any bonds, incur any indebtedness, or grant its credit to anyone. Thus, there is no violation of subdivision (a) (2) of this section. Industrial Dev. Auth. v. Suthers, 208 Va. 51, 155 S.E.2d 326 (1967), commented on in 53 Va. L. Rev. 1556 (1967); 3 U. Rich. L.

        - Where it was contemplated that the issuance of bonds in accordance with contract would bind future boards of supervisors to make annual appropriations of sufficient funds to finance the bonds, and manifestly, the animating purpose of the bond contract arrangement was to create a long-term debt, without submitting the debt to a vote of the qualified voters of the county, the obligation thus incurred would be a "debt contracted by the county" in violation of this article, and hence, the bond issue would be invalid.

       (a) Subject to such criteria and conditions as the General Assembly may prescribe, the Board shall divide the Commonwealth into school divisions of such geographical area and school-age population as will promote the realization of the prescribed standards of quality, and shall periodically review the adequacy of existing school divisions for this purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
       (c) It shall certify to the school board of each division a list of qualified persons for the office of division superintendent of schools, one of whom shall be selected to fill the post by the division school board. In the event a division school board fails to select a division superintendent within the time prescribed by law, the Board of Education shall appoint him.

        Summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs was reversed as the city could not be required to fund a federal court order mandating the system-wide retrofitting of city schools, under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.S.
    12131-34, without any determination that the city discriminated against or otherwise excluded plaintiffs from its services and activities; to impose a funding obligation on the city in the absence of any underlying finding of liability disrespected the long-standing structure of local government and impaired the Commonwealth's ability to structure its state institutions and run its schools. The settlement terms ultimately reached by plaintiffs and the school board as a result of arms-length negotiation were obligations on the school board's part and it could present whatever ADA duties it had, not only to the city, but also to other funding entities.

       <p>
        To say that the constitutional power to supervise includes authority to bargain collectively with labor organizations is to say, at the same time, that the General Assembly could not prohibit school boards from so bargaining; this would be not only unrealistic but also a subversion of the powers of the General Assembly.

       </p>
       <p>
        To the extent that the policies of a county board and school board permit collective bargaining and collective bargaining agreements with recognized labor organizations, the policies are invalid and because the contracts entered into are the products of such collective bargaining, the agreements are void.

        - This section, while vesting "supervision" of public schools in local school boards, does not define the powers and duties involved in that supervision. The general power to supervise does not necessarily include the right to designate the individuals over whom supervision is to be exercised. If the legislature deems it advisable to vest the power of enrollment or placement of pupils in an authority other than the local school boards, it may do so without depriving such local school boards of any express or implied constitutional power of supervision.

       The General Assembly may provide for loans to, and grants to or on behalf of, students attending nonprofit institutions of higher education in the Commonwealth whose primary purpose is to provide collegiate or graduate education and not to provide religious training or theological education. The General Assembly may also provide for a State agency or authority to assist in borrowing money for construction of educational facilities at such institutions, provided that the Commonwealth shall not be liable for any debt created by such borrowing. The General Assembly may also provide for the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof to contract with such institutions for the provision of educational or other related services.

        - The phrase "theological education" is applicable to a seminary or other institution whose purpose is to prepare students for vocations associated with ordination, such as rabbi, minister or priest. By contrast, the phrase "religious training" is applicable to institutions or departments within institutions whose purpose is preparation of students for religious vocations other than those associated with ordination, which would include missionary or director of religious education. In either case, the primary function is educating students for religious vocations. Virginia College Bldg. Auth. v. Lynn, 260 Va. 608, 538 S.E.2d 682, 2000 Va. LEXIS 147 (2000).

        - Although a university was pervasively sectarian in both policy and practice, the primary purpose of its programs, except in its divinity school, was to prepare graduate students for secular vocations and the fact that it taught various secular subjects from a religious viewpoint did not preclude the validation of bonds under this section; the prohibition in this section relating to schools that provide religious training or theological education does not proscribe teaching of otherwise secular subjects from a religious viewpoint.

To the contrary, it must be presumed that approval was given in light of the "modest" proposals of the Commission on Constitutional Revision. Those proposals displayed the clear intent to limit the manner of repayment of loans to methods substantially following the given example of public service to the Commonwealth. Miller v.

       There shall be a permanent commission which shall be known as the State Corporation Commission and which shall consist of three members. The General Assembly may, by majority vote of the members elected to each house, increase the size of the Commission to no more than five members. Members of the Commission shall be elected by the General Assembly and shall serve for regular terms of six years. At least one member of the Commission shall have the qualifications prescribed for judges of courts of record, and any Commissioner may be impeached or removed in the manner provided for the impeachment or removal of judges of courts of record. The General Assembly may enact such laws as it deems necessary for the retirement of the Commissioners, with such conditions, compensation, and duties as it may prescribe. The General Assembly may also provide for the mandatory retirement of Commissioners after they reach a prescribed age, beyond which they shall not serve, regardless of the term to which elected or appointed. Whenever a vacancy in the Commission shall occur or exist when the General Assembly is in session, the General Assembly shall elect a successor for such unexpired term. If the General Assembly is not in session, the Governor shall forthwith appoint pro tempore a qualified person to fill the vacancy for a term ending thirty days after the commencement of the next regular session of the General Assembly, and the General Assembly shall elect a successor for such unexpired term.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       The Commission shall annually elect one of its members chairman. Its subordinates and employees, and the manner of their appointment and removal, shall be as provided by law, except that its heads of divisions and assistant heads of divisions shall be appointed and subject to removal by the Commission.

        In matters relating to the establishment of rates and charges of transmission and transportation companies the State Corporation Commission exercises a purely legislative function and is as to these matters the legislative branch of the government. In the exercise of this power it may change any part of a filed schedule or rate or regulation affecting rates. The only constitutional limitation on this power is that its exercise shall be reasonable and just. City of Newport News v. C & P Tel. Co., 198 Va. 645, 96 S.E.2d 145 (1957).

        In performing the duty of fixing reasonable and just rates for a public service corporation providing heat, light and power service, the State Corporation Commission exercises a legislative function delegated to it by the legislature of Virginia by
    56-235, by virtue of this section of the Constitution. The power delegated by the legislature has the same attributes as the power directly delegated by the Constitution. Board of Supvrs. v. VEPCO, 196 Va. 1102, 87 S.E.2d 139 (1955); City of Norfolk v. VEPCO, 197 Va. 505, 90 S.E.2d 140 (1955).

        State Corporation Commission properly denied the utility rate committees' petition challenging the constitutionality of a transitional rate statute because the committees did not overcome the strong presumption that it was constitutional inasmuch as the commission had no inherent power simply because it was created by the constitution, rather its ratemaking authority was a legislative function delegated to it by the general assembly, which, in turn was granted that authority under the constitution, and the commission's authority to regulate rates was "subject to" such criteria and other requirements as might be prescribed by law.

        In fixing rates within the limits of what is confiscatory to the utility on the one side, and exorbitant as against the public on the other side, and thus definitely unfair and unjust to the telephone users, there is a reasonably wide area within which the Commission is empowered to exercise its legislative discretion.

    2, in ruling on the company's rate adjustment application: (1) the company explicitly asked the Commission to exercise its authority to adjust its capped rates, which relief clearly involved the exercise of the Commission's legislative, rate-making authority; (2) the fact that the Commission had to interpret a previously issued memorandum of understanding (MOU) to determine the allowable rate adjustment did not transform the issue before the Commission from a legislative matter to a question of law; (3) the Commission did not abuse its discretion in adopting its staff's interpretation of the MOU, rather than the interpretation proffered by the company; and (4) the Commission did not abuse its discretion in determining that the company was entitled to recover approximately $9.48 million in purchased power costs, rather than the $37.2 million that it requested, because the MOU allowed only for the recovery of purchased power costs with regard to the company's power needs above its default service load of up to 367 MW.

The State Corporation Commission correctly entered an order denying appellant such authority.

        In reviewing the action of the State Corporation Commission in fixing a valuation of the property of a public utility for rate-making purposes, the Supreme Court must, if the Commission has certified the facts, and has stated the reasons for its findings, regard the same as prima facie just, reasonable and correct, because the Commission is the department of government especially charged with the duty of fixing rates and charges, and especially equipped for and experienced in that field of public service.

      <br/>
      <p>
       All property, except as hereinafter provided, shall be taxed. All taxes shall be levied and collected under general laws and shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, except that the General Assembly may provide for differences in the rate of taxation to be imposed upon real estate by a city or town within all or parts of areas added to its territorial limits, or by a new unit of general government, within its area, created by or encompassing two or more, or parts of two or more, existing units of general government. Such differences in the rate of taxation shall bear a reasonable relationship to differences between nonrevenue producing governmental services giving land urban character which are furnished in one or several areas in contrast to the services furnished in other areas of such unit of government.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       The General Assembly may by general law and within such restrictions and upon such conditions as may be prescribed authorize the governing body of any county, city, town or regional government to provide for differences in the rate of taxation imposed upon tangible personal property owned by persons not less than sixty-five years of age or persons permanently and totally disabled as established by general law who are deemed by the General Assembly to be bearing an extraordinary tax burden on said tangible personal property in relation to their income and financial worth.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       The General Assembly may define and classify taxable subjects. Except as to classes of property herein expressly segregated for either State or local taxation, the General Assembly may segregate the several classes of property so as to specify and determine upon what subjects State taxes, and upon what subjects local taxes, may be levied.

        The dominant purpose of these provisions is to distribute the burden of taxation, so far as is practical, evenly and equitably.

        Considerations of uniformity should not be divorced from the concept of fair market value; the two constitutional principles must be read and construed together.

It means only that a taxpayer whose property is assessed at its true market value has a right to have the assessment reduced to the percentage of that value at which others are taxed so as to meet the uniformity required by this section as well as by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

        Neither the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution nor the equality and uniformity requirements of the state constitutions prohibit the making of classifications in state legislation relating to taxation. The power of a state to make reasonable and natural classifications for purposes of taxation, it has been said, is clear and not questioned. Such classifications may be made with respect to the subjects of taxation generally, the kinds of property to be taxed, the rates to be levied or the amounts to be raised, or the methods of assessment, valuation and collection.

Thus, while a board of supervisors had authority to impose county levies for county purposes upon all property located in the county, still the territorial limit of its authority to levy uniform district taxes was confined to the limits of the particular magisterial district for the benefit of which the taxes were imposed, and they could levy varying rates in different districts in the same county.

        - All assessments of real estate shall be at their fair market value, and the court concluded that the circuit court did not err in striking the taxpayer's evidence because the taxpayer's burden to prove that real property was assessed at more than its fair market value necessarily required that the taxpayer establish the property's fair market value. Because the real property at issue consisted of condominium units, the taxpayer was required to, but failed to, produce evidence to show the fair market value of each individual unit pursuant to
    55-79.42; moreover, to the extent there were market-driven impediments to selling the units individually and limitations on the rental income that could be realized, such factors may affect each unit's fair market value, but, they did not alter the statutory requirement that condominiums be treated as separate parcels of real estate and be separately assessed,
    55-79.42, or the taxpayer's burden to establish each unit's fair market value in order to show that its real property was assessed at more than fair market value as required by subsection A of

    15.2-4911), prior to its amendment in 1968, had the effect of permitting nonuniformity of taxation in violation of this section, not only as between lessees of industrial authority property in a municipality but also as between lessees of such property and lessees of private property. That is so because the amount of the fixed sum to be paid by lessees of industrial authority property, although required by the statute to be "equal to local property taxes and assessments," was to be the subject of negotiation between the interested parties.

       All assessments of real estate and tangible personal property shall be at their fair market value, to be ascertained as prescribed by law. The General Assembly may define and classify real estate devoted to agricultural, horticultural, forest, or open space uses, and may by general law authorize any county, city, town, or regional government to allow deferral of, or relief from, portions of taxes otherwise payable on such real estate if it were not so classified, provided the General Assembly shall first determine that classification of such real estate for such purpose is in the public interest for the preservation or conservation of real estate for such uses. In the event the General Assembly defines and classifies real estate for such purposes, it shall prescribe the limits, conditions, and extent of such deferral or relief. No such deferral or relief shall be granted within the territorial limits of any county, city, town, or regional government except by ordinance adopted by the governing body thereof.

Because the real property at issue consisted of condominium units, the taxpayer was required to, but failed to, produce evidence to show the fair market value of each individual unit pursuant to
    55-79.42; moreover, to the extent there were market-driven impediments to selling the units individually and limitations on the rental income that could be realized, such factors may affect each unit's fair market value, but, they did not alter the statutory requirement that condominiums be treated as separate parcels of real estate and be separately assessed, or the taxpayer's burden to establish each unit's fair market value in order to show that its real property was assessed at more than fair market value as required by subsection A of

       <p>
        City's tax assessments of a taxpayer's property were erroneous because the city assessor's methodology was incorrect and not in accordance with generally acceptable appraisal practices, and the valuation was more than the fair market value; the taxpayer met its burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence, thus rebutting the presumption that the assessor's valuation was correct.

        Constitutional provision regarding assessments for purposes of taxation states that all assessments of real estate and tangible personal property shall be at their fair market value, to be ascertained as prescribed by law; that phrase does not limit the General Assembly from enacting legislation surrounding the appeal by a taxpayer of a county's assessment. Accordingly, the statute regarding the assessments of local levies does not permit the county to make non-fair market value assessments; it is merely legislation that provides for what a taxpayer must establish to overcome the presumption that the county has made a fair market value assessment.

        - City's assessments of real property consisting of a golf course and club house were the result of manifest error because the opinions of the owner's expert were more credible than the opinions of the city's expert, as (1) the owner's expert cast a broader net in finding comparable sales, and the owner's expert's adjustments to account for differences between comparable sales and the subject property were less severe, (2) the owner's expert's approach of only considering comparable sales that were closed or under contract as of January 1 of the relevant tax year was more consistent with sound appraisal practices, (3) the owner's expert properly gave the clubhouse no value when valuing the property at the property's highest and best use as a residential community, since the clubhouse would not be a significant amenity for such a use, and (4) the city's expert's appraisal was based on the disfavored development approach.

Furthermore, the city's failure to consider replacement reserve was not in error, the value assigned to the convention center appeared to be appropriate, and the evidence and testimony provided by the taxpayer was insufficient to overcome the presumption of uniformity in favor of the tax assessor.

In such cases, redress may be had at the locality's board of equalization, by bringing the situation to the attention of the local commissioner of the revenue, or by judicial appeal.

      </h3>
      <p>
       (a)
    Except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, the following property and no other shall be exempt from taxation, State and local, including inheritance taxes:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) Property owned directly or indirectly by the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof, and obligations of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof exempt by law.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) Real estate and personal property owned and exclusively occupied or used by churches or religious bodies for religious worship or for the residences of their ministers.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) Private or public burying grounds or cemeteries, provided the same are not operated for profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       (4) Property owned by public libraries or by institutions of learning not conducted for profit, so long as such property is primarily used for literary, scientific, or educational purposes or purposes incidental thereto. This provision may also apply to leasehold interests in such property as may be provided by general law.
      </p>
      <p>
       (5) Intangible personal property, or any class or classes thereof, as may be exempted in whole or in part by general law.
      </p>
      <p>
       (6) Property used by its owner for religious, charitable, patriotic, historical, benevolent, cultural, or public park and playground purposes, as may be provided by classification or designation by an ordinance adopted by the local governing body and subject to such restrictions and conditions as provided by general law.
      </p>
      <p>
       (7) Land subject to a perpetual easement permitting inundation by water as may be exempted in whole or in part by general law.
      </p>
      <p>
       (8) One motor vehicle owned and used primarily by or for a veteran of the armed forces of the United States or the Virginia National Guard who has been rated by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs or its successor agency pursuant to federal law with a one hundred percent service-connected, permanent, and total disability. For purposes of this subdivision, the term "motor vehicle" shall include only automobiles and pickup trucks. Any such motor vehicle owned by a married person may qualify if either spouse is a veteran who is one hundred percent disabled pursuant to this subdivision. This exemption shall be applicable on the date the motor vehicle is acquired or the effective date of this subdivision, whichever is later, but shall not be applicable for any period of time prior to the effective date.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b)
    The General Assembly may by general law authorize the governing body of any county, city, town, or regional government to provide for the exemption from local property taxation, or a portion thereof, within such restrictions and upon such conditions as may be prescribed, of real estate and personal property designed for continuous habitation owned by, and occupied as the sole dwelling of, persons not less than sixty-five years of age or persons permanently and totally disabled as established by general law. A local governing body may be authorized to establish either income or financial worth limitations, or both, in order to qualify for such relief.
      </p>
      <p>
       (c)
    Except as to property of the Commonwealth, the General Assembly by general law may restrict or condition, in whole or in part, but not extend, any or all of the above exemptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       (d)
    The General Assembly may define as a separate subject of taxation any property, including real or personal property, equipment, facilities, or devices, used primarily for the purpose of abating or preventing pollution of the atmosphere or waters of the Commonwealth or for the purpose of transferring or storing solar energy, and by general law may allow the governing body of any county, city, town, or regional government to exempt or partially exempt such property from taxation, or by general law may directly exempt or partially exempt such property from taxation.
      </p>
      <p>
       (e)
    The General Assembly may define as a separate subject of taxation household goods, personal effects and tangible farm property and products, and by general law may allow the governing body of any county, city, town, or regional government to exempt or partially exempt such property from taxation, or by general law may directly exempt or partially exempt such property from taxation.

        - The words "and no other," in the opening paragraph of this section in the Constitution of 1902, specifying that "the following property and no other shall be exempt from taxation," were held to evidence a policy and prescribe a rule of strict construction. Commonwealth v. Trustees Evergreen Burial Park, 176 Va. 9, 10 S.E.2d 495 (1940).

       <p>
        Under the present Constitution, which became effective July 1, 1971, the rule in Virginia is that exemption of property from taxation shall be strictly construed and, under this rule, exemption from taxation is the exception, and where there is any doubt, the doubt is resolved against the one claiming exemption and the housing and health care facility came into existence and acquired its property after July 1, 1971. Hence, its claim to exemption must be strictly construed, and this meant that entitlement to exemption must have appeared clearly from the statutory provisions upon which it relies. Westminster-Canterbury of Hampton Rds., Inc. v. City of Virginia Beach, 238 Va. 493, 385 S.E.2d 561 (1989).

        - Under the Constitution of 1869, by
    3 of Art. X, the legislature had authority to exempt certain classes of property, but when the Constitution of 1902 became effective all tax exemptions were thereby fixed, and there could be no other such exemptions. It was the purpose of the Convention that framed the Constitution of 1902 thereafter to make it impossible for the legislature to create any exemptions from taxation, for it not only provided in detail affirmatively just what property could be exempted from taxation, but expressly denied the legislature the power to add thereto, and specifically prohibited the exemption of any other property. No historical discussion of the provisions of former constitutions or legislation could make obscure the clear meaning of the Constitution of 1902 on this question. Hollywood Cem. Co. v. Commonwealth, 123 Va. 106, 96 S.E. 207 (1918).

       <p>
        - The 1985 amendment to subsection A of
    58.1-3606 was significant because it stated a specific legislative intent to exercise the authority under Va. Const, Art. X,
    6 (a)(6) to create new property exemptions by classification. The exemptions under this section were no longer limited to any specific date. Property qualifying under one of the listed classes "shall be exempt from taxation" regardless of when the organization seeking the exemption was created or the property acquired. Thus, the 1985 amendment expanded or created new property tax exemptions. Children, Inc. v. City of Richmond, 251 Va. 62, 466 S.E.2d 99 (1996).

       <p>
        - The 1971 Constitution, however, required that tax exemptions enacted under Article X, Section 6(a)(6) be strictly construed. A major effect of the 1985 amendments to
    58.1-3606, therefore, was the imposition of a rule of strict construction upon the tax exemption classifications. Children, Inc. v. City of Richmond, 251 Va. 62, 466 S.E.2d 99 (1996).

        In summary, the 1985 amendments to Code
    58.1-3606 under the authority of Article X, Section 6(f) created exemptions by classification for classes of property owned and used by certain benevolent, charitable, and other organizations. The exemptions must be strictly construed, unless subsection B is applicable to the claimed exemption. In that case, liberal rules of construction may be applied. Children, Inc. v. City of Richmond, 251 Va. 62, 466 S.E.2d 99 (1996).

       <p>
        - Church property, which is in the process of being developed for its intended use and is being used for certain church-related activities, may be tax exempt; such a determination, however, depends on a question of fact and is, therefore, reserved for the local commissioner of the revenue or other appropriate taxing official. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Richard H. Black and The Honorable Thomas Davis Rust, Members, House of Delegates, 02-088 (11/19/02).

       <p>
        Certain real property and improvements used and occupied by a religious association do qualify for exemption from local taxation under subdivision A 5 of
    58.1-3606. A nonprofit property holding company that is organized for religious purposes retains the same property tax exemption as its sole member, an incorporated church.

       (a)
    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6, the General Assembly by general law, and within the restrictions and conditions prescribed therein, shall exempt from taxation the real property, including the joint real property of husband and wife, of any veteran who has been determined by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs or its successor agency pursuant to federal law to have a one hundred percent service-connected, permanent, and total disability, and who occupies the real property as his or her principal place of residence. The General Assembly shall also provide this exemption from taxation for real property owned by the surviving spouse of a veteran who was eligible for the exemption provided in this subdivision, so long as the surviving spouse does not remarry. This exemption applies to the surviving spouse's principal place of residence without any restriction on the spouse's moving to a different principal place of residence.

       (b)
    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6, the General Assembly by general law, and within the restrictions and conditions prescribed therein, may exempt from taxation the real property of the surviving spouse of any member of the armed forces of the United States who was killed in action as determined by the United States Department of Defense, who occupies the real property as his or her principal place of residence. The exemption under this subdivision shall cease if the surviving spouse remarries and shall not be claimed thereafter. This exemption applies regardless of whether the spouse was killed in action prior to the effective date of this subdivision, but the exemption shall not be applicable for any period of time prior to the effective date. This exemption applies to the surviving spouse's principal place of residence without any restriction on the spouse's moving to a different principal place of residence and without any requirement that the spouse reside in the Commonwealth at the time of death of the member of the armed forces.

        including grant funds from the United States government. Where the General Assembly has provided for the appropriation of such funds, the Governor lawfully may disburse such funds. Whether the Governor lawfully can accept such funding in the future by providing the required "assurance" of funding levels in subsequent years depends upon whether such a pledge represents a political commitment by the Governor or a legal pledge purporting to bind the General Assembly. The Governor may provide a political pledge to use his best efforts to secure a particular level of funding. The Governor may not, acting on his own, bind the General Assembly to provide future spending. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Robert G.

        § 8. Limit of tax or revenue; Revenue Stabilization Fund.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <br/>
      <p>
       No other or greater amount of tax or revenues shall, at any time, be levied than may be required for the necessary expenses of the government, or to pay the indebtedness of the Commonwealth.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       The General Assembly shall establish the Revenue Stabilization Fund.
    The Fund shall consist of an amount not to exceed fifteen percent of the Commonwealth's average annual tax revenues derived from taxes on income and retail sales as certified by the Auditor of Public Accounts for the three fiscal years immediately preceding.
    The Auditor of Public Accounts shall compute the fifteen percent limitation of such fund annually and report to the General Assembly not later than the first day of December.
    "Certified tax revenues" means the Commonwealth's annual tax revenues derived from taxes on income and retail sales as certified by the Auditor of Public Accounts.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       The General Assembly shall make deposits to the Fund to equal at least fifty percent of the product of the certified tax revenues collected in the most recently ended fiscal year times the difference between the annual percentage increase in the certified tax revenues collected for the most recently ended fiscal year and the average annual percentage increase in the certified tax revenues collected in the six fiscal years immediately preceding the most recently ended fiscal year.
    However, growth in certified tax revenues, which is the result of either increases in tax rates on income or retail sales or the repeal of exemptions therefrom, may be excluded, in whole or in part, from the computation immediately preceding for a period of time not to exceed six calendar years from the calendar year in which such tax rate increase or exemption repeal was effective.
    Additional appropriations may be made at any time so long as the fifteen percent limitation established herein is not exceeded.
    All interest earned on the Fund shall be part thereof; however, if the Fund's balance exceeds the limitation, the amount in excess of the limitation shall be paid into the general fund after appropriation by the General Assembly.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       The General Assembly may appropriate an amount for transfer from the Fund to compensate for no more than one-half of the difference between the total general fund revenues appropriated and a revised general fund revenue forecast presented to the General Assembly prior to or during a subsequent regular or special legislative session. However, no transfer shall be made unless the general fund revenues appropriated exceed such revised general fund revenue forecast by more than two percent of certified tax revenues collected in the most recently ended fiscal year.
    Furthermore, no appropriation or transfer from such fund in any fiscal year shall exceed more than one-half of the balance of the Revenue Stabilization Fund.
    The General Assembly may enact such laws as may be necessary and appropriate to implement the Fund.

       The General Assembly may, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the members elected to each house, authorize the creation of debt to which the full faith and credit of the Commonwealth is pledged, for capital projects to be distinctly specified in the law authorizing the same; provided that any such law shall specify capital projects constituting a single purpose and shall not take effect until it shall have been submitted to the people at an election and a majority of those voting on the question shall have approved such debt. No such debt shall be authorized by the General Assembly if the amount thereof when added to amounts approved by the people, or authorized by the General Assembly and not yet submitted to the people for approval, under this subsection during the three fiscal years immediately preceding the authorization by the General Assembly of such debt and the fiscal year in which such debt is authorized shall exceed twenty-five per centum of an amount equal to 1.15 times the average annual tax revenues of the Commonwealth derived from taxes on income and retail sales, as certified by the Auditor of Public Accounts, for the three fiscal years immediately preceding the authorization of such debt by the General Assembly.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       No debt shall be incurred under this subsection if the amount thereof when added to the aggregate amount of all outstanding debt to which the full faith and credit of the Commonwealth is pledged other than that excluded from this limitation by the provisions of this Article authorizing the contracting of debts to redeem a previous debt obligation of the Commonwealth and for certain revenue-producing capital projects, less any amounts set aside in sinking funds for the repayment of such outstanding debt, shall exceed an amount equal to 1.15 times the average annual tax revenues of the Commonwealth derived from taxes on income and retail sales, as certified by the Auditor of Public Accounts, for the three fiscal years immediately preceding the incurring of such debt.

      <p>
       All debt incurred under this subsection shall mature within a period not to exceed the estimated useful life of the projects as stated in the authorizing law, which statement shall be conclusive, or a period of thirty years, whichever is shorter; and all debt incurred to redeem a previous debt obligation of the Commonwealth, except that which is secured by net revenues anticipated to be sufficient to pay the same and provide reserves therefor, shall mature within a period not to exceed thirty years. Such debt shall be amortized, by payment into a sinking fund or otherwise, in annual installments of principal to begin not later than one tenth of the term of the bonds, and any such sinking fund shall not be appropriated for any other purpose; if such debt be for public road purposes, such payment shall be first made from revenues segregated by law for the construction and maintenance of State highways. No such installment shall exceed the smallest previous installment by more than one hundred per centum. If sufficient funds are not appropriated in the budget for any fiscal year for the timely payment of the interest upon and installments of principal of such debt, there shall be set apart by direction of the Governor, from the first general fund revenues received during such fiscal year and thereafter, a sum sufficient to pay such interest and installments of principal.

      </p>
      <p>
       (1) the creation of such debt is authorized by the affirmative vote of two thirds of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly; and

       (2) such debt is created for specific revenue-producing capital projects (including the enlargement or improvement thereof), which shall be distinctly specified in the law authorizing the same, of institutions and agencies administered solely by the executive department of the Commonwealth or of institutions of higher learning of the Commonwealth.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       Before any such debt shall be authorized by the General Assembly, and again before it shall be incurred, the Governor shall certify in writing, filed with the Auditor of Public Accounts, his opinion, based upon responsible engineering and economic estimates, that the anticipated net revenues to be pledged to the payment of principal of and interest on such debt will be sufficient to meet such payments as the same become due and to provide such reserves as the law authorizing such debt may require, and that the projects otherwise comply with the requirements of this subsection, which certifications shall be conclusive.

      <br/>
      <p>
       No debt shall be incurred under this subsection if the amount thereof when added to the aggregate amount of all outstanding debt authorized by this subsection and the amount of all outstanding debt incurred to redeem a previous debt obligation of the Commonwealth which is to be included in the limitation of this subsection by virtue of the provisions of this Article authorizing the contracting of debts to redeem a previous debt obligation of the Commonwealth, less any amounts set aside in sinking funds or the payment of such debt, shall exceed an amount equal to 1.15 times the average annual tax revenues of the Commonwealth derived from taxes on income and retail sales, as certified by the Auditor of Public Accounts, for the three fiscal years immediately preceding the incurring of such debt.

       <b>
        Special fund doctrine discussed.
       </b>
       <p>
        - Broadly speaking, a debt within the constitutional limitation on the power to incur indebtedness, is an obligation secured by the general faith and credit of the State. If the political entity is made generally liable, then an indebtedness is created within the debt limitations of the Constitution. Conversely, if the obligation is to be discharged solely from a special fund and the faith and credit of the State are not involved, it is not a debt within this constitutional sense. Button v. Day, 204 Va. 270, 130 S.E.2d 459 (1963).
        <b>
         Obligation payable from special fund is not debt within limitation.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The special fund doctrine permits revenue bonds to be issued for certain qualifying state revenue projects without violating the constitutional debt limitations. Under the doctrine, no constitutionally prohibited indebtedness is created when bonds issued to finance a particular state capital project are to be paid solely from a special fund derived from the revenues of that project; when the legislature is not obligated to appropriate funds for payment of the indebtedness; and, when the indebtedness is not secured by the general faith, credit and taxing power of the State. Miller v. Watts, 215 Va. 836, 214 S.E.2d 165 (1975).
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p>
        - The special fund principle is applicable whether the obligations are to be paid solely from revenues derived from the particular project or projects which are constructed or purchased with the funds derived from the proceeds of the sale of the obligations, or whether the obligations are to be payable partly from a similar source and partly from the increases in revenues from other existing projects. In each case the obligations are to be payable solely from a special fund. In none is the general credit of the State pledged for the payment of the obligations, nor may the holders of such obligations look to the State's general revenues for payment. Button v. Day, 204 Va. 270, 130 S.E.2d 459 (1963).

       </b>
       <p>
        - Subdivision (c) is a unique constitutional provision. Although its genesis is the special fund doctrine, it goes beyond this doctrine by authorizing the creation of debt for specific self-liquidating revenue-producing capital projects secured by a pledge of the full faith and credit of the Commonwealth. Miller v. Watts, 215 Va. 836, 214 S.E.2d 165 (1975).

       <b>
        Subdivision (c) goes beyond special fund doctrine.

       <p>
        is to permit the General Assembly, under limited circumstances and under strict safeguards, to place the full faith and credit of the Commonwealth behind certain self-liquidating revenue-producing state capital projects and thereby save large sums in interest on the bonds.

       </b>
       <p>

        More advantageous debt terms intended.
       </b>
       <p>
        - The Commonwealth, as guarantor, makes a binding commitment for payment of bonds issued under subdivision (c). No such obligatory undertaking by the Commonwealth is incurred in traditional revenue bonds issued under the special fund doctrine. Miller v. Watts, 215 Va. 836, 214 S.E.2d 165 (1975).

        Prior to the adoption of the Constitution of 1869, the State of Virginia had freely extended its credit and aid to corporations engaged in developing and operating privately owned works of internal improvement, such as canals, turnpikes and railroads, in the hope that the success of such undertakings would bring prosperity and benefit to the public. As a result of this policy large obligations were incurred and severe losses suffered by the State. Faced with these facts, the Constitutional Convention resolved that the State should no longer lend its support to such undertakings but should leave them to private enterprise. Almond v. Day, 199 Va. 1, 97 S.E.2d 824 (1957); Harrison v. Day, 200 Va. 764, 107 S.E.2d 594 (1959).

        One of the underlying purposes of these restrictive provisions was to encourage and foster the construction of such works of internal improvement by private enterprise by prohibiting the State from competing in that field. Almond v. Day, 199 Va. 1, 97 S.E.2d 824 (1957).
       </p>

        The purpose of this provision is to protect the State and its political subdivisions from losses which they might incur by aiding those engaged in privately owned works of internal improvement. Button v. Day, 203 Va. 687, 127 S.E.2d 122 (1962).

        - A county, before it advertised for bids from contractors for certain road work, made a contract with appellant that appellant would furnish crushed stone to any and all contractors to whom the road work might be subsequently let at a special price, and in consideration of the furnishing of the stone for such use at such price, the county, on its part, guaranteed to the appellant payment for the same. It was held that this contract did not fall within the inhibition of this section. Holston Corp. v. Wise County, 131 Va. 142, 109 S.E. 180 (1921).

Such trust funds shall be invested as authorized by law. Retirement system benefits shall be funded using methods which are consistent with generally accepted actuarial principles. The retirement system shall be subject to restrictions, terms, and conditions as may be prescribed by the General Assembly.

       - An amendment to this section was proposed and agreed to by the General Assembly at the 1995 Regular Session (Acts 1995, cc. 704 and 708) and was referred to the 1996 Session. It was again agreed to at that Session (Acts 1996, cc. 4 and 909) and submitted to the people November 5, 1996, when it was ratified. The amendment, effective January 1, 1997, in the heading of the section, substituted "employees" for "employee" and deleted "fund" following "retirement system," substituted "retirement system for state employees and employees of participating political subdivisions and school divisions" for "state employees retirement system to be administered in the best interest of the beneficiaries thereof and subject to such restrictions or conditions as may be prescribed by the General Assembly" at the end of the first sentence and added the second through the sixth sentences.

        - Trial court did not err in considering the public trust doctrine in determining whether the property owner's application for an after-the-fact permit for a storage shed on his pier that went into the creek should be granted; indeed, the state constitution expressly directed that the state or a state agency consider the public welfare when making such a decision.

        Legislature did not restrict the commission's judgment to any decision making formula intended to dictate the outcome of the commission's permitting decision and, thus, the commission did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it approved the owner's after-the-fact permit application to include an upper deck bar structure on the owner's pier after a hurricane. The commission was guided in its decision by an emphasis on preserving the environment, by a concern for the public having access to public lands for recreation, and maintaining as a public trust the public resources for the benefit, enjoyment, and general welfare of the Commonwealth's people, as required by Va. Const., Art. XI,

        - This section prohibits the legislature from leasing, renting, or selling the natural oyster beds, rocks, and shoals in the waters of the State, and declares that the same shall be held in trust for the benefit of the people of this State, but there is no other inhibition in the Constitution on the powers of the legislature over the beds of navigable waters of the State. The result is that the legislature has the power to dispose of such beds and the waters flowing over them subject to the public use of navigation, and such other public use, if any, as is held by the State for the benefit of all the people.
