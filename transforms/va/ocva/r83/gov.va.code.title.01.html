     History of Code of 1950 and cumulative supplement.
    </b>
    - The proposed Code of Virginia, submitted by the then Commission on Code Recodification to the 1948 session of the General Assembly, with certain amendments fully explained in the preface and known as the "Reorganization Provisions of the Code of Virginia," was adopted as the Code of Virginia, to be effective as provided in
    
     <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.01.html#t01c01s1-2" target="_blank">§§
    
    1-2</a></cite> and<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.01.html#t01c01s1-2.1" target="_blank"> 1-2.1</a></cite>, by an act approved April 6, 1948.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under authority and direction of chapter 262 of the Acts of 1948, codified as former

    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    30-152 et seq.), the Commission, now styled the Virginia Code Commission, prepared and had published an annotated edition, in ten volumes including the index, of the Code so adopted, with the reorganization provisions and the general acts of the 1948 session incorporated therein.
      </p>
      <p>
       This edition was submitted to the General Assembly for approval at its 1950 session and was adopted by an act approved January 27, 1950.
      </p>
      <p>
       The final paragraph of that act, which has not been codified, read in part: ". . . the body of the statute law contained in the foregoing ten volumes is to take effect February one, nineteen hundred fifty as the official Code of Virginia, sometimes for brevity called the Code of 1950."
      </p>
      <p>
       The general acts of the 1950 through 2014 sessions have been codified and published, under authority of

        - This section is not expressly controlling or directly in point on a legal question presented in an action arising under the Federal Housing and Rent Act of 1947 to recover damages and attorney's fees for rentals charged in excess of the maximum rent that could be charged, where such act is later repealed, because the alleged right of action asserted arose under a federal act.

Applying the formula set forth in the Virginia statutes for valuing debtor husband's single life estate in the real property, the court determined that debtor husband was not insolvent or rendered insolvent by the conveyance and thus, the transfer was not avoidable as constructively fraudulent under the Bankruptcy Code and Virginia law.

         Resort to original statutes.

        - Notwithstanding the fact that the Codes of 1887 and 1919 were revisions of the statute law, if the various sections of one of the Codes were harmonious and their meaning plain, resort could not be had in construing them to the original statutes to see if any error was committed in the revision. If, however, there was a substantial doubt as to the meaning of the sections, the law which was the subject of the revision could be looked to in ascertaining their meaning. If they were inconsistent and could not stand together, the original statutes, and the respective dates of their enactment, could be examined to see what was the last expression of the will of the legislature on the subject. Gaines' Adm'r v. Marye, 94 Va. 225, 26 S.E. 511 (1897); W.S. Forbes & Co. v. Southern Cotton Oil Co., 130 Va. 245, 108 S.E. 15 (1921); Xippas v. Commonwealth, 141 Va. 497, 126 S.E. 207 (1925).

         Change in phraseology is not important.

        Code revisors often make such changes and shorten statutes with no intention to change their substance, and no change in substance will be construed as intended unless it plainly appears. Keister's Adm'r v. Keister's Ex'rs, 123 Va. 157, 96 S.E. 315 (1918); Norfolk & Portsmouth Bar Ass'n v. Drewry, 161 Va. 833, 172 S.E. 282 (1934).

        - Acts 1932, p. 24, added the latter part of the section [now subsection A of this section], relating to notice or act required by statute within a certain time after an event or judgment. With this exception, this rule of construction as to computation of time has been on the statute books of the State, with a brief intermission, for over a century. Acts 1916, ch. 290, p. 508, made radical changes in the language of this provision, and extended the rule of construction to contracts, but the language of the old section was restored by the Code of 1919, which went into effect January 8, 1920. Kelly v. Trehy, 133 Va. 160, 112 S.E. 757 (1922). See School Bd. v. Alexander, 126 Va. 407, 101 S.E. 349 (1919).

        - Hence, where a final decree, from which an appeal was obtained, was entered on April 24, the period for executing the appeal bond did not begin to run until April 25. Hurley v. Bennett, 163 Va. 241, 176 S.E. 171 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to 1932, a different holding prevailed. See Kelly v. Trehy, 133 Va. 160, 112 S.E. 757 (1922) (time for filing bill of exceptions); Swift & Co. v. Wood, 103 Va. 494, 49 S.E. 643 (1905) (time for return of notice of motion for judgment); Jennings v. Pocahontas Consol. Collieries Co., 114 Va. 213, 76 S.E. 298 (1912) (time for filing declaration).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, when a statute or rule of court requires a notice to be given or any other act to be done within a certain time after any event or judgment, that time shall be in addition to the day on which the event or judgment took place; thus here, the five month speedy trial time allowance under

         Statute heading just informative convenience.

        - It is well-settled that the words of the statute, not its heading, carry the force of law. The heading of the statute is purely a matter of informative convenience. The court must construe the body of the statute. Jones v. Division of Child Support Enforcement ex rel. Owens, 19 Va. App. 184, 450 S.E.2d 172 (1994); Foster v.

        - In the construction of an act, its title is entitled to its due share of consideration, and while a headline is not strictly a title, it occupies a closely related position. It contains catchwords which are intended to indicate the contents of a section. Jordan v. Town of South Boston, 138 Va. 838, 122 S.E. 265 (1924). See Chambers v.

        Amendment, if adopted, would not expand the meaning of "damages" to such an extent that it would enable the owners of property located in the vicinity of, or affected by, an unpopular public facility to recover damages when none of their land has been taken for the facility.

Miller, Member, House of Delegates,<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.11.html#t11c2.1s11-135" target="_blank"> 11-135</a></cite>, 2012 Va. AG LEXIS 3 (1/26/12).

        Design and construction of highways and roads, including the installation of medians and other traffic management and safety features, represent the exercise of the Commonwealth's police power, the exercise of which generally is not compensable under the current Constitution, provided that a reasonable means of ingress and egress for an abutting property remains; whether limitations on vehicular access will be compensable under the proposed amendment will depend on how the General Assembly defines by statute "lost access" and "lost profits," but a property owner likely will have an opportunity to present to the body determining just compensation evidence of the damages alleged to have been sustained. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Jackson H. Miller, Member, House of Delegates,<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.11.html#t11c2.1s11-135" target="_blank"> 11-135</a></cite>, 2012 Va. AG LEXIS 3 (1/26/12).

        Temporary closure of street for a weekend festival or to accommodate a parade represents the reasonable exercise of police power by a locality, is not a taking or damaging of property and, thus, would not be compensable if the proposed amendment is adopted.

        When the word "person" is used in a statute, corporations as well as natural persons are included for civil purposes. B & O R.R. v. Gallahue's Adm'rs, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 655 (1855). See Sun Life Assurance Co. v. Bailey, 101 Va. 443, 44 S.E. 692 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word "person" in a former statute relating to persons paying taxes on real estate was held to include "corporations." Crafford v. Board of Supvrs., 87 Va. 110, 12 S.E. 147 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        In support of the rule that corporations are to be deemed and taken as persons when the circumstances in which they are placed are identical with those of natural persons, see Stribling v. Bank of Valley, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 132 (1827); Bank of United States v. Merchants' Bank, 40 Va. (1 Rob.) 573 (1843); B & O R.R. v. Gallahue's Adm'rs, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 655 (1855).

        But it has been held that a city charter giving authority to impose a license tax upon persons engaged in certain enumerated callings, and "upon any other person or employment," did not empower the city to impose such tax upon a railroad corporation, which is neither a person nor employment within the ordinary acceptation of these words. City of Lynchburg v. Norfolk & W.R.R., 80 Va. 237 (1885).

        A city is a "person" whose rights may be prejudiced by a forgery. Hanbury v. Commonwealth, 203 Va. 182, 122 S.E.2d 911 (1961).

        Municipal corporations have a dual identity, existing both as a body politic and a body corporate; in the latter identity, a municipal corporation may be a "person" just as any corporation or other legal entity is a person. City of Va. Beach v. Flippen, 251 Va. 358, 467 S.E.2d 471 (1996).

        - Where district judge awarded sanctions to city since plaintiffs should have known that the city was incapable of forming the criminal intent necessary for liability under the Virginia Conspiracy Act, where the Virginia Conspiracy Act itself does not clearly state whether cities can be subjected to liability, where the Virginia Supreme Court has not been confronted directly with whether a city is a person within the meaning of the Virginia Conspiracy Act, and where a recent pronouncement of the Supreme Court in a Virginia Conspiracy Act case seemed to have left open the possibility that a city could be sued under that act, the district court abused its discretion in sanctioning plaintiffs since the court of appeals was unable to say that plaintiffs had "absolutely no chance of success" in bringing a Virginia Conspiracy Act claim against the city.

        </b>
        - This section or a predecessor has been the law of Virginia for more than 100 years and has long been held to apply to civil as well as criminal cases. Pursuant to it, both substantive and vested rights are protected from retroactive application of statutes. Garraghty v. Virginia, Dep't of Cors., 52 F.3d 1274 (4th Cir. 1995).

        - Where statute changed the status of the offense charged from a felony to a misdemeanor after entry of the defendants' guilty plea but prior to his sentencing and the Commonwealth agreed to pursue misdemeanor sentencing, it was discretionary with the trial court, and not with the Commonwealth, whether misdemeanor or felony punishment should be imposed.

        A statute which amended the former law as to payment of decedents' debts by inserting in the third class "debts of trustee for persons under disabilities," was only prospective in its operation and did not authorize the placing of a debt as trustee in the third class, though the estate was not distributed until the act went into operation.

        Where a provision of a curative act amending a former law with reference to the assessment of land for taxes, if construed retrospectively, would deprive a citizen of the opportunity to be heard as to the correctness and justice of an assessment made under the original act, which opportunity was afforded by the original act, such provision will, if possible, be construed prospectively only, and the remedy given under the original act as to acts done prior to the passage of the curative act will be preserved.

         Repealing statute referring solely to matters of remedy and procedure.
        </b>
        - This section prescribes a rule of construction of a new law repealing a former law where rights have accrued or arise under the former law. It has no application to a repealing statute referring solely to matters of remedy and procedure where the legislature expressly declares it shall have retroactive operation. Appellants are given no right in the strict sense to a particular mode of procedure unless they avail themselves of it while the statute is in force. Phipps v.

        - This section saves from the operation of a repealing statute substantive claims and rights, but has no application to a change by repeal of a mere rule of evidence; and it cannot bind a future legislature which expressed a contrary intention in a repealing statute.

       <p>
        The intention of the legislature to repeal Act March 13, 1912, relating to the effect to be given as evidence to deeds recorded prior to 1865, as shown by Act March 14, 1914, cannot be overthrown by this section, prescribing a rule for the construction of statutes in case of repeals.

        Where a defendant commits an offense before a new, mitigatory statute goes into effect but comes to trial after the new statute goes into effect, the penalty in existence at the time of the offense should be applied unless the Commonwealth first elects to proceed under the new statute and obtains the consent of the defendant to do so.

       </p>
       <p>
        It is, of course, fundamental that local ordinances must conform to and not be in conflict with the public policy of the state as embodied in its statutes. Blanton v. Amelia County, 261 Va. 55, 540 S.E.2d 869, 2001 Va. LEXIS 16 (2001).

        <b>
         But may enlarge thereon.
        </b>
        - The fact that an ordinance enlarges upon statutory provisions does not necessarily create an inconsistency therewith, since some state statutes are not sufficiently comprehensive to cover local exigencies. Allen v. City of Norfolk, 196 Va. 177, 83 S.E.2d 397 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that the State, in the exercise of the police power, has made certain regulations does not prohibit a municipality from exacting additional requirements, so long as there is no conflict. King v. County of Arlington, 195 Va. 1084, 81 S.E.2d 587 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that an ordinance enlarges upon the provisions of a statute by requiring more than the statute requires creates no conflict therewith, unless the statute limits the requirement for all cases to its own prescription. Blanton v. Amelia County, 261 Va. 55, 540 S.E.2d 869, 2001 Va. LEXIS 16 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where both an ordinance and a statute are prohibitory and the only difference between them is that the ordinance goes further in its prohibition, but not counter to the prohibition under the statute, and the municipality does not attempt to authorize by the ordinance what the legislature has forbidden or forbid what the legislature has expressly licensed, authorized, or required, there is nothing contradictory between the provisions of the statute and the ordinance because of which they cannot coexist and be effective. Blanton v. Amelia County, 261 Va. 55, 540 S.E.2d 869, 2001 Va. LEXIS 16 (2001).

        - The fact that the penalty for the violation of an ordinance prohibiting the use of common towels is greater than that provided for in the statute on the subject does not invalidate the ordinance. National Linen Serv. Corp. v. City of Norfolk, 196 Va. 277, 83 S.E.2d 401 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinance held not invalid because it enlarged on the statute by prescribing a heavier penalty for the second offense. Allen v. City of Norfolk, 196 Va. 177, 83 S.E.2d 397 (1954).

         If both the statute and ordinance can stand together, courts are obliged to harmonize them,

        The Maryland-Virginia Compact of 1785, and the description of boundary lines and rights in the Potomac river contained therein, does not apply to the District of Columbia; when Maryland and Virginia ceded land to the District, they relinquished any joint interest in, and control over, that part of the river located within the District.
    Consequently, a Virginia resident, fishing from the Virginia shore, was subject to the laws of the District of Columbia when fishing with a dip net in that part of the Potomac river controlled by the District of Columbia. Evans v. United States, 31 App. D.C. 544 (1908).

However, the exact location of the boundary between Virginia and Maryland involves an interpretation of this section and represents a legal question outside the jury's province. If it were impossible for the jurors to interpret the evidence concerning the body's exact placement so as to conclude under this section that the body lay in Virginia, the trial court should not have submitted the issue of venue to the jury.

Since victim's body lay six to seven and one-half feet from the Commonwealth of Virginia, venue did not lie in Loudoun County and the appellant's conviction would be reversed. Traverso v.

        <b>
         The question whether a federal area within a state is subject to exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
        </b>
        is complicated and often difficult to decide. A determination depends upon many factors, jurisdiction being subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions, limitations and provisions of the acquisition by the United States, including the consent of the State and acceptance by the United States. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Commonwealth ex rel. SCC, 204 Va. 421, 132 S.E.2d 407 (1963).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The presumption prevails that the State has jurisdiction over land
        </b>
        which is owned by United States unless a defendant shows that the United States was deeded the land and accepted jurisdiction over it. Smith v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 455, 248 S.E.2d 135 (1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 967, 99 S. Ct. 2419, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1074 (1979).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Jurisdiction may be transferred to the general government by cession.
        </b>
        The terms of cession, to the extent that they may lawfully be prescribed, determine the extent of the federal jurisdiction. United States v. Schuster, 220 F. Supp. 61 (E.D. Va. 1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The argument that a state is powerless to surrender its jurisdiction to the United States over privately owned lands is without merit. United States v. Schuster, 220 F. Supp. 61 (E.D. Va. 1963).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The reservation in an act of cession of concurrent jurisdiction with the United States
        </b>
        over land, so that the courts and officers of the State may take such cognizance, execute such process and discharge such legal functions within the same as may not be incompatible with the consent given, is subject to the provisions of Article 1,
        §
        8 of the federal Constitution, that is, as may not be incompatible with the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, and may operate to authorize the service by the officers of the State of the civil and criminal process of its courts, with reference to acts done within the acknowledged territory of the State outside of the ceded lands. This reservation is valid and is intended to prevent such places from becoming harbors of refuge for debtors and criminals. Foley v. Shriver, 81 Va. 568 (1886).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Retention of right to serve process does not prevent cession of jurisdiction.
        </b>
        - The mere fact that the State has retained the right to serve criminal and civil process on land described in this section is not effective to prevent cession of exclusive or concurrent criminal jurisdiction to the federal government. The purpose of this reservation is to prevent the land involved from becoming an asylum for fugitives from justice. United States v. Schuster, 220 F. Supp. 61 (E.D. Va. 1963).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         And practice is to permit federal government to prosecute.
        </b>
        - The practice which exists in this area with respect to crimes committed on lands "acquired" in any manner by the United States is to permit - indeed, to require - the federal government to prosecute. The State adopts a "hands off" policy. United States v. Schuster, 220 F. Supp. 61 (E.D. Va. 1963).

         Does not affect personal status of resident.
        </b>
        - The right of the State to serve process in territory ceded to the United States does not affect the personal status of a resident in such territory. Such person does not thereby acquire a residence in this State so as to defeat the right of a creditor to attach his property in this State on the ground that he is a nonresident. Bank of Phoebus v. Byrum, 110 Va. 708, 67 S.E. 349 (1910).

         State ceded concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed on lands transferred to the federal government.
        </b>
        - Virginia consented to cede only "concurrent jurisdiction" to the United States to prosecute crimes committed on lands transferred to the federal government; the presumption in favor of concurrent jurisdiction was rebuttable, but only by a clear manifestation of a specific intent to do so. Campbell v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 180, 571 S.E.2d 906, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 681 (2002).

The deed shall accurately and specifically describe the area and location of the land over which the additional jurisdiction and powers are ceded and shall set out specifically what additional jurisdiction and powers are ceded, and may set out any reservations in the Commonwealth of jurisdiction which may be deemed proper in addition to those referred to in subsection D.

       The respective jurisdiction and powers of the Commonwealth and the United States over all lands within the Shenandoah National Park, as it is now constituted or may hereafter be extended, shall be as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t01c04s1-402ol11">
        Criminal and police jurisdiction. - The United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction, legislative, executive and judicial, with respect to the commission of crimes, and the arrest, trial and punishment therefor, and exclusive general police jurisdiction thereover.

        Sale of alcoholic beverages. - The United States shall have the power to regulate or prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages on such lands; provided, that, if the sale of alcoholic beverages is prohibited by general law in the Commonwealth outside of such lands, no such alcoholic beverages shall be sold on the lands contained in the Park area; and provided further, that if the general laws of the Commonwealth permit the sale of alcoholic beverages, then the regulations of the United States relating to such sales on such lands shall conform as nearly as possible to the regulatory provisions in accordance with which such sales are permitted in the Commonwealth outside of such Park lands. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as reserving in the Commonwealth power to require licenses of persons engaged in the sale of intoxicating beverages on such lands, nor the power to require that any sales be made through official liquor stores.
       </li>
       <li id="t01c04s1-402ol13">
        Service of civil and criminal process. - The Commonwealth shall have jurisdiction to serve civil process within the limits of the Park in any suits properly instituted in any of the courts of the Commonwealth and to serve criminal process within such limits in any suits or prosecutions for or on account of crimes committed in the Commonwealth but outside of the Park.

        Tax on motor vehicle fuels and lubricants. - The Commonwealth shall have jurisdiction and power to tax the sales of oil and gasoline, and other motor vehicle fuels and lubricants for use in motor vehicles. This subsection shall not be construed as a consent by the United States to the taxation by the Commonwealth of such sales for the exclusive use of the United States.
       </li>
       <li id="t01c04s1-402ol16">
        Tax on businesses. - The Commonwealth shall have jurisdiction and power to levy nondiscriminatory taxes on private individuals, associations and corporations, their franchises and properties, on such lands, and on their businesses conducted thereon.
       </li>

        Jurisdiction of courts. - The courts of the Commonwealth shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts of the United States of all civil causes of action arising on such lands to the same extent as if the cause of action had arisen in the county or city in which the land lies outside the Park area, and the state officers shall have jurisdiction to enforce on such lands the judgments of the state courts and the collection of taxes by appropriate process.

        Voting residence. - Persons residing in or on any of the lands embraced in the Park shall have the right to establish a voting residence in the Commonwealth by reason thereof, and the consequent right to vote at all elections within the county or city in which the land or lands upon which they reside are located upon like terms and conditions, and to the same extent as they would be entitled to vote in such county or city if the lands on which they reside had not been deeded or conveyed to the United States.

       The plane coordinates of a point on the earth's surface, to be used in expressing the position or location of such point in the appropriate zone of these systems, shall be expressed in U.S. survey feet and decimals of a foot. One of these distances, to be known as the "x-coordinate," shall give the position in an east-and-west direction; the other, to be known as the "y-coordinate," shall give the position in a north-and-south direction. These coordinates shall be made to depend upon and conform to the coordinate values for the monumented points of the North American Horizontal Geodetic Control Network as published by the National Ocean Service/National Geodetic Survey, or its successors, and whose plane coordinates have been computed on the systems defined in this chapter. Any such station may be used for establishing a survey connection to either Virginia coordinate system.

      <p>
       When converting coordinates in the Virginia Coordinate System of 1983 from meters and decimals of a meter to feet and decimals of a foot, the U.S. survey foot conversion factor (one foot equals 1200/3937 meters) shall be used. This requirement does not preclude the continued use of the International foot conversion factor (one foot equals 0.3048 meters) in those counties and cities where this factor was in use prior to July 1, 1992. The plat or plan shall contain a statement of the conversion factor used and the coordinate values of a minimum of two project points in feet.
