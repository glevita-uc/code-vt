     History of Code of 1950 and cumulative supplement.
    </b>
    - The proposed Code of Virginia, submitted by the then Commission on Code Recodification to the 1948 session of the General Assembly, with certain amendments fully explained in the preface and known as the "Reorganization Provisions of the Code of Virginia," was adopted as the Code of Virginia, to be effective as provided in
    
     <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.01.html#t01c01s1-2" target="_self">§§
    
    1-2</a></cite> and<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.01.html#t01c01s1-2.1" target="_self"> 1-2.1</a></cite>, by an act approved April 6, 1948.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under authority and direction of chapter 262 of the Acts of 1948, codified as former
    
     <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.09.html#t09c9-66" target="_blank">§§

    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    30-152 et seq.), the Commission, now styled the Virginia Code Commission, prepared and had published an annotated edition, in ten volumes including the index, of the Code so adopted, with the reorganization provisions and the general acts of the 1948 session incorporated therein.
      </p>
      <p>
       This edition was submitted to the General Assembly for approval at its 1950 session and was adopted by an act approved January 27, 1950.
      </p>
      <p>
       The final paragraph of that act, which has not been codified, read in part: ". . . the body of the statute law contained in the foregoing ten volumes is to take effect February one, nineteen hundred fifty as the official Code of Virginia, sometimes for brevity called the Code of 1950."
      </p>
      <p>
       The general acts of the 1950 through 2014 sessions have been codified and published, under authority of
       §
       30-152 et seq., in the supplements and in the added and replacement volumes.

        - Under Virginia's stranger to title doctrine, which it retained from the common law, debtor wife, who did not have title in property prior to a conveyance of debtor husband's half interest to his daughter, did not become a grantor by virtue of the fact that the deed purported to reserve her a life estate. Applying the formula set forth in the Virginia statutes for valuing debtor husband's single life estate in the real property, the court determined that debtor husband was not insolvent or rendered insolvent by the conveyance and thus, the transfer was not avoidable as constructively fraudulent under the Bankruptcy Code and Virginia law.

     Code is one act and construed as a whole.

    - The Code of 1887 was held to be one act, which must be construed as a whole. Gaines' Adm'r v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Code of 1919 was held a single act, and its different sections were regarded, not as prior and subsequent acts, but as simultaneous expressions of the legislative will. It was further held that all provisions therein dealing with the same subject should be construed together and reconciled whenever possible. Shepherd v. F.J. Kress Box Co., <cite class="va_code">154 Va. 421</cite>, 153 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 649</cite> (1930), citing Piedmont Fin. Corp. v.

     Resort to original statutes.
    </b>
    - Notwithstanding the fact that the Codes of 1887 and 1919 were revisions of the statute law, if the various sections of one of the Codes were harmonious and their meaning plain, resort could not be had in construing them to the original statutes to see if any error was committed in the revision. If, however, there was a substantial doubt as to the meaning of the sections, the law which was the subject of the revision could be looked to in ascertaining their meaning. If they were inconsistent and could not stand together, the original statutes, and the respective dates of their enactment, could be examined to see what was the last expression of the will of the legislature on the subject. Gaines' Adm'r v. Marye, <cite class="va_code">94 Va. 225</cite>, 26 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 511</cite> (1897); W.S. Forbes &amp; Co. v.

        <b>
     Intention to alter old law by revision must plainly appear.
    </b>
    - The settled rule in construing the Code is that the old law was not intended to be altered, unless such intention plainly appears. Durrett v. Davis, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 302 (1874); Hamilton v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">143 Va. 572</cite>, 130 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 383</cite> (1925). See Parramore v. Taylor, 52 Va. (11 Gratt.) 220 (1854); Davis v. Commonwealth, 58 Va.

        <b>
     Change in phraseology is not important.
    </b>
    Code revisors often make such changes and shorten statutes with no intention to change their substance, and no change in substance will be construed as intended unless it plainly appears. Keister's Adm'r v. Keister's Ex'rs, <cite class="va_code">123 Va. 157</cite>, 96 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 315</cite> (1918); Norfolk &amp; Portsmouth Bar Ass'n v.

       <p>
        <b>
     Revised or substituted statute omitting provisions in original.
    </b>
    - It is a general rule that when a revised statute, or one reenacted for another, omits provisions contained in original act, the omitted part cannot be supplied by construction. Richmond-Ashland Ry. v. Commonwealth ex rel. City of Richmond, <cite class="va_code">162 Va. 296</cite>, 173 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 892</cite> (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a statute is revised, or when one act is framed from another, and portions of the former are omitted, the missing part will not be revived by statutory construction but will be considered as annulled and revoked. Godlewski v. Gray, <cite class="va_code">221 Va. 1092</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 213 (1981).

        <b>
     Construction of one section considered in construing similar sections.
    </b>
    - The construction placed upon language used in one section of the Code may be considered in determining the meaning of similar or the same language used in other sections. First Nat'l Bank v. Holland, <cite class="va_code">99 Va. 495</cite>, 39 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 126</cite> (1901).

        <b>
     If there is conflict between the body of a statute and a proviso,

    <br/>

       <p>
        <b>
     When a statute has been construed by the courts and is then reenacted
    </b>
    by the legislature, the construction given to it is presumed to be sanctioned by the legislature and therefore becomes obligatory upon the courts. Kelly v. Trehy, <cite class="va_code">133 Va. 160</cite>, 112 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 757</cite> (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the General Assembly enacts a statute in language with a long history of definition by the Supreme Court, it intends that the words carry their historical construction. Quintana v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">224 Va. 127</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 643 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1029, 103 S. Ct. 1280, 75 L. Ed. 2d 501, rehearing denied, 461 U.S. 940, 103 S. Ct. 2113, 77 L.

    - Acts 1932, p. 24, added the latter part of the section [now subsection A of this section], relating to notice or act required by statute within a certain time after an event or judgment. With this exception, this rule of construction as to computation of time has been on the statute books of the State, with a brief intermission, for over a century. Acts 1916, ch. 290, p. 508, made radical changes in the language of this provision, and extended the rule of construction to contracts, but the language of the old section was restored by the Code of 1919, which went into effect January 8, 1920.

    - It is well-settled that the words of the statute, not its heading, carry the force of law. The heading of the statute is purely a matter of informative convenience. The court must construe the body of the statute. Jones v. Division of Child Support Enforcement ex rel. Owens, 19 Va. App. 184, 450 S.E.2d 172 (1994); Foster v.

     Transferrable development rights.
    </b>
    - Transferrable development rights are entirely creatures of statute and they are governed by a specific statutory regime. Two things must occur for transferrable development rights to come into being. First, the county must approve an application from an eligible sending site, and, second, the county must approve a receiving site. The dedication of density or other rights, i.e., the creation of transferrable development rights, occurs under
    
     §
    
    15.2-750 when both conditions have been fulfilled. The transferrable development rights have potential value before that, but until the county approves a sending site and a receiving site, in the eyes of the law, the transferrable development rights remain an inchoate interest or right. Once the transferrable development rights are created by the county's approval of a sending and a receiving site, they become a right or interest in real estate under the broad definition found in

      <p>
       A.
    The right to private property being a fundamental right, the General Assembly shall not pass any law whereby private property shall be taken or damaged for public uses without just compensation. The term "public uses" mentioned in Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of Virginia is hereby defined as to embrace only the acquisition of property where: (i) the property is taken for the possession, ownership, occupation, and enjoyment of property by the public or a public corporation; (ii) the property is taken for construction, maintenance, or operation of public facilities by public corporations or by private entities provided that there is a written agreement with a public corporation providing for use of the facility by the public; (iii) the property is taken for the creation or functioning of any public service corporation, public service company, or railroad; (iv) the property is taken for the provision of any authorized utility service by a government utility corporation; (v) the property is taken for the elimination of blight provided that the property itself is a blighted property; or (vi) the property taken is in a redevelopment or conservation area and is abandoned or the acquisition is needed to clear title where one of the owners agrees to such acquisition or the acquisition is by agreement of all the owners.
      </p>
      <p>
       B.
    For purposes of this section:
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Blighted property"
       means any property that endangers the public health or safety in its condition at the time of the filing of the petition for condemnation and is (i) a public nuisance or (ii) an individual commercial, industrial, or residential structure or improvement that is beyond repair or unfit for human occupancy or use.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Government utility corporation"
       means any county or municipality, or entity or agency thereof, which provides or operates one or more of the following authorized utility services: gas, pipeline, electric light, heat, power, water supply, sewer, telephone, or telegraph.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Public corporation"
       means the Commonwealth of Virginia or any political subdivision thereof or any incorporated municipality therein or any public agency of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision thereof or of any municipality therein.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Public facilities"
       means (i) airports, landing fields, and air navigation facilities; (ii) educational facilities; (iii) flood control, bank and shore protection, watershed protection, and dams; (iv) hospital facilities; (v) judicial and court facilities; (vi) correctional facilities, including jails and penitentiaries; (vii) library facilities; (viii) military installations; (ix) parks so designated by the Commonwealth or by the locality in its comprehensive plan; (x) properties of historical significance so designated by the Commonwealth; (xi) law enforcement, fire, emergency medical, and rescue facilities; (xii) sanitary sewer, water or stormwater facilities; (xiii) transportation facilities including highways, roads, streets, and bridges, traffic signals, related easements and rights-of-way, mass transit, ports, and any components of federal, state, or local transportation facilities; (xiv) waste management facilities for hazardous, radioactive, or other waste; (xv) office facilities occupied by a public corporation; and (xvi) such other facilities that are necessary to the construction, maintenance, or operation of a public facility as listed in clauses (i) through (xv) and directly related thereto.
      </p>
      <p>
       C.
    No more private property may be taken than that which is necessary to achieve the stated public use.
      </p>
      <p>
       D.
    Except where property is taken (i) for the creation or functioning of a public service corporation, public service company, or railroad; (ii) for the provision of any authorized utility service by a government utility corporation; or (iii) for sanitary sewer, water or stormwater facilities, or transportation facilities, including highways, roads, streets, and bridges, traffic signals, related easements and rights-of-way, mass transit, ports, and any components of federal, state, or local transportation facilities, by a public corporation, property can only be taken where: (a) the public interest dominates the private gain and (b) the primary purpose is not private financial gain, private benefit, an increase in tax base or tax revenues, an increase in employment, or economic development.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.
    During condemnation proceedings, the property owner may challenge whether the taking or damaging is for a public use, the stated public use is a pretext for an unauthorized use, or the taking or damaging of property is a violation of subsection D. Nothing in this section shall be construed as abrogating any defenses or rights otherwise available to the property owner independently of this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       F.
    Subject to the provisions of subsection D, the limitations contained in this section shall not abrogate any other provision of law that authorizes a condemnor to dispose of property taken for a public use as surplus property, as otherwise provided by law.

         Proposed constitutional amendment.
        </b>
        - Damages sustained when a major cross-town highway is converted to a limited access only highway that eliminates all direct access to the major highway by abutting landowners are compensable under the current Constitution and will remain compensable under the amendment. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Jackson H. Miller, Member, House of Delegates, 11-135, 2012 Va. AG LEXIS 3 (1/26/12).
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment, if adopted, would not expand the meaning of "damages" to such an extent that it would enable the owners of property located in the vicinity of, or affected by, an unpopular public facility to recover damages when none of their land has been taken for the facility. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Jackson H. Miller, Member, House of Delegates, 11-135, 2012 Va. AG LEXIS 3 (1/26/12).
       </p>
       <p>
        Design and construction of highways and roads, including the installation of medians and other traffic management and safety features, represent the exercise of the Commonwealth's police power, the exercise of which generally is not compensable under the current Constitution, provided that a reasonable means of ingress and egress for an abutting property remains; whether limitations on vehicular access will be compensable under the proposed amendment will depend on how the General Assembly defines by statute "lost access" and "lost profits," but a property owner likely will have an opportunity to present to the body determining just compensation evidence of the damages alleged to have been sustained. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Jackson H. Miller, Member, House of Delegates, 11-135, 2012 Va. AG LEXIS 3 (1/26/12).
       </p>
       <p>
        Temporary closure of street for a weekend festival or to accommodate a parade represents the reasonable exercise of police power by a locality, is not a taking or damaging of property and, thus, would not be compensable if the proposed amendment is adopted. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Jackson H. Miller, Member, House of Delegates, 11-135, 2012 Va. AG LEXIS 3 (1/26/12).

     Corporations.
    </b>
    - Corporations are included under the term "persons" as used in a statute, unless they are exempted by its terms or by the nature of the subject to which the statute relates. Miller's Ex'r v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 110 (1876). See Portsmouth Gas Co. v. Sanford, <cite class="va_code">97 Va. 124</cite>, 33 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 516</cite> (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the word "person" is used in a statute, corporations as well as natural persons are included for civil purposes. B &amp; O R.R. v. Gallahue's Adm'rs, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 655 (1855). See Sun Life Assurance Co. v. Bailey, <cite class="va_code">101 Va. 443</cite>, 44 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 692</cite> (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word "person" in a former statute relating to persons paying taxes on real estate was held to include "corporations." Crafford v. Board of Supvrs., <cite class="va_code">87 Va. 110</cite>, 12 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 147</cite> (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        In support of the rule that corporations are to be deemed and taken as persons when the circumstances in which they are placed are identical with those of natural persons, see Stribling v. Bank of Valley, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 132 (1827); Bank of United States v. Merchants' Bank, 40 Va. (1 Rob.) 573 (1843); B & O R.R. v. Gallahue's Adm'rs, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 655 (1855).
       </p>
       <p>
        But it has been held that a city charter giving authority to impose a license tax upon persons engaged in certain enumerated callings, and "upon any other person or employment," did not empower the city to impose such tax upon a railroad corporation, which is neither a person nor employment within the ordinary acceptation of these words. City of Lynchburg v. Norfolk &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="va_code">80 Va. 237</cite> (1885).

        A city is a "person" whose rights may be prejudiced by a forgery. Hanbury v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">203 Va. 182</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 911 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Municipal corporations have a dual identity, existing both as a body politic and a body corporate; in the latter identity, a municipal corporation may be a "person" just as any corporation or other legal entity is a person.

        - Where district judge awarded sanctions to city since plaintiffs should have known that the city was incapable of forming the criminal intent necessary for liability under the Virginia Conspiracy Act, where the Virginia Conspiracy Act itself does not clearly state whether cities can be subjected to liability, where the Virginia Supreme Court has not been confronted directly with whether a city is a person within the meaning of the Virginia Conspiracy Act, and where a recent pronouncement of the Supreme Court in a Virginia Conspiracy Act case seemed to have left open the possibility that a city could be sued under that act, the district court abused its discretion in sanctioning plaintiffs since the court of appeals was unable to say that plaintiffs had "absolutely no chance of success" in bringing a Virginia Conspiracy Act claim against the city.

        </b>
        - This section or a predecessor has been the law of Virginia for more than 100 years and has long been held to apply to civil as well as criminal cases. Pursuant to it, both substantive and vested rights are protected from retroactive application of statutes. Garraghty v. Virginia, Dep't of Cors., 52 F.3d 1274 (4th Cir. 1995).

        - Where statute changed the status of the offense charged from a felony to a misdemeanor after entry of the defendants' guilty plea but prior to his sentencing and the Commonwealth agreed to pursue misdemeanor sentencing, it was discretionary with the trial court, and not with the Commonwealth, whether misdemeanor or felony punishment should be imposed.

       <p>
        A statute which amended the former law as to payment of decedents' debts by inserting in the third class "debts of trustee for persons under disabilities," was only prospective in its operation and did not authorize the placing of a debt as trustee in the third class, though the estate was not distributed until the act went into operation.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a provision of a curative act amending a former law with reference to the assessment of land for taxes, if construed retrospectively, would deprive a citizen of the opportunity to be heard as to the correctness and justice of an assessment made under the original act, which opportunity was afforded by the original act, such provision will, if possible, be construed prospectively only, and the remedy given under the original act as to acts done prior to the passage of the curative act will be preserved.

    - This section prescribes a rule of construction of a new law repealing a former law where rights have accrued or arise under the former law. It has no application to a repealing statute referring solely to matters of remedy and procedure where the legislature expressly declares it shall have retroactive operation. Appellants are given no right in the strict sense to a particular mode of procedure unless they avail themselves of it while the statute is in force. Phipps v. Sutherland, <cite class="va_code">201 Va. 448</cite>, 111 S.E.2d 422 (1959); Virginia &amp; W. Va. Coal Co. v. Charles, 251 F. 83 (W.D.

         Statute repealing rule of evidence.
        </b>
        - This section saves from the operation of a repealing statute substantive claims and rights, but has no application to a change by repeal of a mere rule of evidence; and it cannot bind a future legislature which expressed a contrary intention in a repealing statute. Virginia & W. Va. Coal Co. v. Charles, 254 F. 379 (4th Cir. 1918), appeal dismissed, 252 U.S. 569, 40 S. Ct. 345, 64 L. Ed. 720 (1920).

       <p>
        The intention of the legislature to repeal Act March 13, 1912, relating to the effect to be given as evidence to deeds recorded prior to 1865, as shown by Act March 14, 1914, cannot be overthrown by this section, prescribing a rule for the construction of statutes in case of repeals. Virginia & W. Va. Coal Co. v. Charles, 251 F. 83 (W.D. Va. 1917), aff'd, 254 F. 379 (4th Cir. 1918), appeal dismissed, 252 U.S. 569, 40 S. Ct. 345, 64 L. Ed. 720 (1920).

        The General Assembly impermissibly delegated taxing power to the local area transportation authority through enactment of Acts 2007, c. 896, because it did not have the constitutional power to delegate taxing authority to an unelected political subdivision, pursuant to Va.

     But may enlarge thereon.
    </b>
    - The fact that an ordinance enlarges upon statutory provisions does not necessarily create an inconsistency therewith, since some state statutes are not sufficiently comprehensive to cover local exigencies.

       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that the State, in the exercise of the police power, has made certain regulations does not prohibit a municipality from exacting additional requirements, so long as there is no conflict. King v. County of Arlington, <cite class="va_code">195 Va. 1084</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 587 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that an ordinance enlarges upon the provisions of a statute by requiring more than the statute requires creates no conflict therewith, unless the statute limits the requirement for all cases to its own prescription. Blanton v. Amelia County, <cite class="va_code">261 Va. 55</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 869, 2001 Va. LEXIS 16 (2001).

       <p>
        Where both an ordinance and a statute are prohibitory and the only difference between them is that the ordinance goes further in its prohibition, but not counter to the prohibition under the statute, and the municipality does not attempt to authorize by the ordinance what the legislature has forbidden or forbid what the legislature has expressly licensed, authorized, or required, there is nothing contradictory between the provisions of the statute and the ordinance because of which they cannot coexist and be effective.

     Virginia locality may not enact an ordinance that preempts or nullifies state or federal law;

    further, a locality may not enact an ordinance that diminishes, alters, or eliminates legal rights, particularly where the state or federal government may be said to 'occupy the field,' unless given specific authority to do so by the General Assembly or the Congress of the United States.

        A local governing body may adopt a zoning ordinance that places restrictions on the location and siting of oil and gas wells that are reasonable in scope and consistent with the Virginia Gas and Oil Act and the Commonwealth Energy Policy.

    - The General Assembly intended to permit localities to prohibit fracking operations through duly enacted land use or zoning ordinances, and the Code of Virginia so provides. Localities may enact zoning restrictions on fracking only if and to the extent that the restrictions are reasonable in scope and are not inconsistent with the Virginia Gas and Oil Act or regulations properly enacted pursuant to the Act.

      </p>
      <p>
       1. An act of the General Assembly passed on January 2, 1781, that resolved that this Commonwealth would on certain conditions yield for the benefit of the United States all her right to the territory northwest of the Ohio River.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. An act of the General Assembly passed on December 20, 1783, that authorized the transfer to the United States, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the act of the United States Congress passed on September 13, 1783 and the deed of cession that was made accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. An act of the General Assembly passed on December 30, 1788, whereby, after referring to an ordinance for the government of the territory, passed by the United States Congress on July 13, 1787, and reciting a particular article declared in the ordinance to be part of the compact between the original states and the people and states in the territory, the article of compact was ratified and confirmed.
      </p>

       <p>
        The Maryland-Virginia Compact of 1785, and the description of boundary lines and rights in the Potomac river contained therein, does not apply to the District of Columbia; when Maryland and Virginia ceded land to the District, they relinquished any joint interest in, and control over, that part of the river located within the District.
    Consequently, a Virginia resident, fishing from the Virginia shore, was subject to the laws of the District of Columbia when fishing with a dip net in that part of the Potomac river controlled by the District of Columbia. Evans v. United States, 31 App. D.C. 544 (1908).

        - The exact physical location of a murder victim's body within river constituted a factual question which the jury could appropriately decide. However, the exact location of the boundary between Virginia and Maryland involves an interpretation of this section and represents a legal question outside the jury's province. If it were impossible for the jurors to interpret the evidence concerning the body's exact placement so as to conclude under this section that the body lay in Virginia, the trial court should not have submitted the issue of venue to the jury.

Since victim's body lay six to seven and one-half feet from the Commonwealth of Virginia, venue did not lie in Loudoun County and the appellant's conviction would be reversed. Traverso v.

        <b>
     The question whether a federal area within a state is subject to exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
    </b>
    is complicated and often difficult to decide. A determination depends upon many factors, jurisdiction being subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions, limitations and provisions of the acquisition by the United States, including the consent of the State and acceptance by the United States. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Commonwealth ex rel. SCC, <cite class="va_code">204 Va. 421</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 407 (1963).

       <p>
        <b>
     The presumption prevails that the State has jurisdiction over land
    </b>
    which is owned by United States unless a defendant shows that the United States was deeded the land and accepted jurisdiction over it. Smith v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">219 Va. 455</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 135 (1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 967, 99 S. Ct. 2419, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1074 (1979).

        <b>
         Jurisdiction may be transferred to the general government by cession.
        </b>
        The terms of cession, to the extent that they may lawfully be prescribed, determine the extent of the federal jurisdiction. United States v. Schuster, 220 F. Supp. 61 (E.D. Va. 1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The argument that a state is powerless to surrender its jurisdiction to the United States over privately owned lands is without merit. United States v. Schuster, 220 F. Supp. 61 (E.D. Va. 1963).

     The reservation in an act of cession of concurrent jurisdiction with the United States
    </b>
    over land, so that the courts and officers of the State may take such cognizance, execute such process and discharge such legal functions within the same as may not be incompatible with the consent given, is subject to the provisions of Article 1,
    
     §
    
    8 of the federal Constitution, that is, as may not be incompatible with the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, and may operate to authorize the service by the officers of the State of the civil and criminal process of its courts, with reference to acts done within the acknowledged territory of the State outside of the ceded lands. This reservation is valid and is intended to prevent such places from becoming harbors of refuge for debtors and criminals. Foley v. Shriver, <cite class="va_code">81 Va. 568</cite> (1886).

        <b>
         Retention of right to serve process does not prevent cession of jurisdiction.
        </b>
        - The mere fact that the State has retained the right to serve criminal and civil process on land described in this section is not effective to prevent cession of exclusive or concurrent criminal jurisdiction to the federal government. The purpose of this reservation is to prevent the land involved from becoming an asylum for fugitives from justice. United States v. Schuster, 220 F. Supp. 61 (E.D. Va. 1963).

        </b>
        - The practice which exists in this area with respect to crimes committed on lands "acquired" in any manner by the United States is to permit - indeed, to require - the federal government to prosecute. The State adopts a "hands off" policy. United States v. Schuster, 220 F. Supp. 61 (E.D. Va. 1963).

        § 1-401. Ceding additional jurisdiction to United States.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       A.
    Whenever the head or other authorized officer of any department or independent establishment or agency of the United States shall deem it desirable that additional jurisdiction or powers be ceded over any lands in the Commonwealth acquired or proposed to be acquired by the United States under his immediate jurisdiction, custody or control, and whenever the Governor and Attorney General of the Commonwealth shall agree to the same, the Governor and Attorney General shall execute and acknowledge a deed in the name of and under the lesser seal of the Commonwealth ceding such additional jurisdiction. The deed shall accurately and specifically describe the area and location of the land over which the additional jurisdiction and powers are ceded and shall set out specifically what additional jurisdiction and powers are ceded, and may set out any reservations in the Commonwealth of jurisdiction which may be deemed proper in addition to those referred to in subsection D.
      </p>
      <p>
       B.
    No such deed shall become effective or operative until the jurisdiction therein provided for is accepted on behalf of the United States as required by 40 U.S.C. § 255. The head or other authorized officer of a department or independent establishment or agency of the United States shall indicate such acceptance by executing and acknowledging such deed and admitting it to record in the office of the clerk of the court in which deeds conveying the lands affected would properly be recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
       C.
    When such deed has been executed and acknowledged on behalf of the Commonwealth and the United States, and admitted to record as provided in subsection B, it shall have the effect of ceding to and vesting in the United States the jurisdiction and powers therein provided for and none other.
      </p>
      <p>
       D.
    Every such deed as is provided for in this section shall reserve in the Commonwealth over all lands therein referred to the jurisdiction and power to serve civil and criminal process on such lands and in the event that the lands or any part thereof shall be sold or leased to any person, under the terms of which sale or lease the vendee or lessee shall have the right to conduct thereon any private industry or business, then the jurisdiction ceded to the United States over any such lands so sold or leased shall cease and determine, and thereafter the Commonwealth shall have all jurisdiction and power she would have had if no jurisdiction or power had been ceded to the United States. This provision, however, shall not apply to post exchanges, officers' clubs and similar activities on lands acquired by the United States for purposes of national defense. It is further provided that the reservations provided for in this subsection shall remain effective even though they should be omitted from any deed executed pursuant to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.
    Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as repealing any special acts ceding jurisdiction to the United States to acquire any specific tract of land.

      </h3>
      <p>
       The respective jurisdiction and powers of the Commonwealth and the United States over all lands within the Shenandoah National Park, as it is now constituted or may hereafter be extended, shall be as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       1. Criminal and police jurisdiction. - The United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction, legislative, executive and judicial, with respect to the commission of crimes, and the arrest, trial and punishment therefor, and exclusive general police jurisdiction thereover.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Sale of alcoholic beverages. - The United States shall have the power to regulate or prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages on such lands; provided, that, if the sale of alcoholic beverages is prohibited by general law in the Commonwealth outside of such lands, no such alcoholic beverages shall be sold on the lands contained in the Park area; and provided further, that if the general laws of the Commonwealth permit the sale of alcoholic beverages, then the regulations of the United States relating to such sales on such lands shall conform as nearly as possible to the regulatory provisions in accordance with which such sales are permitted in the Commonwealth outside of such Park lands. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as reserving in the Commonwealth power to require licenses of persons engaged in the sale of intoxicating beverages on such lands, nor the power to require that any sales be made through official liquor stores.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Service of civil and criminal process. - The Commonwealth shall have jurisdiction to serve civil process within the limits of the Park in any suits properly instituted in any of the courts of the Commonwealth and to serve criminal process within such limits in any suits or prosecutions for or on account of crimes committed in the Commonwealth but outside of the Park.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. Tax on alcoholic beverages. - The Commonwealth shall have jurisdiction and power to levy a nondiscriminatory tax on all alcoholic beverages possessed or sold on such lands.
      </p>
      <p>
       5. Tax on motor vehicle fuels and lubricants. - The Commonwealth shall have jurisdiction and power to tax the sales of oil and gasoline, and other motor vehicle fuels and lubricants for use in motor vehicles.

      <p>
       The plane coordinates of a point on the earth's surface, to be used in expressing the position or location of such point in the appropriate zone of these systems, shall be expressed in U.S. survey feet and decimals of a foot. One of these distances, to be known as the "x-coordinate," shall give the position in an east-and-west direction; the other, to be known as the "y-coordinate," shall give the position in a north-and-south direction. These coordinates shall be made to depend upon and conform to the coordinate values for the monumented points of the North American Horizontal Geodetic Control Network as published by the National Ocean Service/National Geodetic Survey, or its successors, and whose plane coordinates have been computed on the systems defined in this chapter. Any such station may be used for establishing a survey connection to either Virginia coordinate system.

       When converting coordinates in the Virginia Coordinate System of 1983 from meters and decimals of a meter to feet and decimals of a foot, the U.S. survey foot conversion factor (one foot equals 1200/3937 meters) shall be used. This requirement does not preclude the continued use of the International foot conversion factor (one foot equals 0.3048 meters) in those counties and cities where this factor was in use prior to July 1, 1992. The plat or plan shall contain a statement of the conversion factor used and the coordinate values of a minimum of two project points in feet.

The geodetic position of stations defining the position of the Virginia Coordinate System of 1983 shall have been rigidly adjusted on the North American Datum of 1983, and the plane coordinates shall have been computed on the Virginia Coordinate System of 1983. Any such station may be used for establishing a survey connection with the Virginia coordinate systems.

       No coordinates based on the Virginia coordinate systems, purporting to define the position of a point on a land boundary, shall be presented to be recorded in any public land records or deed records unless such point is within two kilometers of a public or private monumented horizontal control station established in conformity with the standards of accuracy and specifications for second-order, class II or better geodetic surveying as prepared and published by the Federal Geodetic Control Subcommittee of the Federal Geographic Data Committee of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Standards and specifications of the Federal Geodetic Control Subcommittee or its successor in force on the date of such survey shall apply. The publishing of the existing control stations, or the acceptance with intent to publish the new established control stations, by the National Ocean Service/National Geodetic Survey constitutes evidence of adherence to the Federal Geodetic Control Subcommittee specifications. The two kilometers' limitation may be modified by a duly authorized state agency to meet local conditions. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be interpreted as preventing the use of the Virginia coordinate systems in any unrecorded deeds, maps, or computations.
