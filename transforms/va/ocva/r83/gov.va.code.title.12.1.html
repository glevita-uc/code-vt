        Editor's note.
       </b>
       - At its regular session of 1970, the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to undertake a general revision of the Code, with particular reference to amendments throughout the Code that would be necessary under the proposed revision of the Constitution of Virginia, subsequently adopted by the voters at the election held on November 3, 1970. In November of 1970 the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report, containing a proposed revision of Title 12, relating to the State Corporation Commission. This report, which was published as House Document No. 2 of the 1971 extra session, contains much valuable explanatory matter, which is, however, too lengthy for inclusion here. The Commission's draft of the revision of Title 12, as amended by the General Assembly, became Chapter 157 of the Acts of 1971, Extra Session. It repealed Title 12 of the Code, and enacted in lieu thereof a new Title 12.1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former law.

     Constitutionality.
    </b>
    - The fact that the State Corporation Commission, created by the Constitution, is invested to a certain extent with legislative, executive and judicial powers does not render it an illegitimate and invalid tribunal. Winchester &amp; S.R.R. v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">106 Va. 264</cite>, 55 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 692</cite> (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Constitution and laws of this State which give to the State Corporation Commission control over common carriers of persons and goods in matters affecting their public duties and charges, require notice to such carriers, give them the most ample opportunity to be heard on all matters of law and fact which they may desire to allege or put forward in their defense, and in event of an adverse decision an appeal of right to the Supreme Court, regardless of the amount in controversy. Such legislation does not deprive them of their property without due process of law, and is not otherwise unconstitutional. Winchester &amp; S.R.R. v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">106 Va. 264</cite>, 55 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 692</cite> (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        The procedures prescribed for protecting consumers' interests satisfy the requirements of the due process clause of the Virginia Constitution and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Howell v. SCC, <cite class="va_code">214 Va. 128</cite>, 198 S.E.2d 611 (1973).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     The Commission's powers are derived from the Constitution and statutes.
    </b>
    - The Corporation Commission is the creation of the Constitution and has no inherent power. All of its jurisdiction is either conferred by the Constitution or derived from statutes which do not contravene the Constitution. City of Richmond v. C &amp; P Tel. Co., <cite class="va_code">127 Va. 612</cite>, 105 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 127</cite> (1920).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         It is not a mere ministerial body.
        </b>
        - The Corporation Commission derives its authority from the Constitution of Virginia and is vested with powers both legislative and judicial. It is the department of government through which are carried out the provisions of the Constitution and of the laws made in pursuance thereof for the control of corporations. It can in no case be considered a mere ministerial body. In re Tidewater & W.R.R., 3 Va. L. Reg. (n.s.) 257 (1917).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         And the ministerial functions of the Commission do not abrogate its constitutional prerogatives.
        </b>
        - No mere ministerial function imposed upon the Corporation Commission can be given the effect of abrogating and taking away its plain constitutional prerogatives. In re Tidewater & W.R.R., 3 Va. L. Reg. (n.s.) 257 (1917).
        <br/>

       <p>
        <b>
         A statute divesting its powers must show clear intention.
        </b>
        - Any statute which has for its purpose the divesting of the power of the Corporation Commission over railroad corporations in their public relations must show the intention of the legislature in no uncertain terms. In re Tidewater & W.R.R., 3 Va. L. Reg. (n.s.) 257 (1917).

     Supervision of railway corporations belongs to Commission.
    </b>
    - The obligations imposed upon railway corporations in this State, whether by the Constitution, statutes, or the common law, are obligations imposed by law. The supervision of the discharge of these obligations is committed to the Corporation Commission. Southern Ry. v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">128 Va. 176</cite>, 105 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 65</cite> (1920).

         Jurisdiction over out of state based risk retention group.
        </b>
        - Where State Corporation Commission administered all laws regulating corporations operating in the state and had specific regulatory jurisdiction over risk retention groups plainly, then, the SCC had subject matter jurisdiction over a Colorado-based risk retention group.

      <p>
       In all matters within the jurisdiction of the Commission, it shall have the powers of a court of record to administer oaths, to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, to punish for contempt, and to enforce compliance with its lawful orders or requirements by adjudging and enforcing by its own appropriate process such fines or other penalties as may be prescribed or authorized by law.

       In the administration and enforcement of all laws within its jurisdiction, the Commission shall have the power to promulgate rules and regulations, to impose and collect such fines or other penalties as are provided by law, to enter appropriate orders, and to issue temporary and permanent injunctions. The Commission is empowered to suspend or revoke any Commission-issued license, certificate, registration, permit, or any other Commission-issued authority of any person who fails to satisfy any fine or penalty imposed by an order of the Commission.

       Whenever no fine or other penalty is specifically imposed by statute for the failure of any such individual or business conducted by any entity other than an individual to comply with any provision of law or with any valid rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, the Commission may impose and collect from such individual or business conducted by any entity other than an individual a fine in an amount not to exceed $5,000 in the case of an individual, and in the case of a business conducted by any entity other than an individual not to exceed $10,000.

    - Imposition of a threshold financial analysis by the State Corporation Commission in setting public utility rates does not constitute the promulgation of a rule or regulation of general application, which may be adopted by the commission only after notice and hearing. Application of the threshold standard is nothing more than a discretionary method of determining whether a rate change is needed. It is not a rule or regulation in the constitutional or statutory sense. Roanoke Gas Co. v. SCC, <cite class="va_code">225 Va. 186</cite>, 300 S.E.2d 785 (1983).

    - A choice of either of two methods having been given to appellants of performing a charter duty, it was error on the part of the State Corporation Commission to have limited them to one of such methods in directing the performance of that duty. It was likewise error to make any order affecting the right of a connecting company which had not been served with process or notice, and was not a party to the proceeding. Winchester &amp; S.R.R. v.

     Hearing waived because of attorney's neglect.

    - It is not reasonably conceivable that an attorney, exercising due care for his client's interests, would accept an equivocal statement that a staff member of the Securities Division of the State Corporation Commission would extend the order to show cause which had been set for hearing from one without any apparent authority and act upon the statement with complete confidence that a binding agreement had been reached concerning a continuance. Neither is it reasonably conceivable that, following his conversation with the staff member, the attorney would fail to contact the commission before the scheduled hearing date to ascertain whether the matter had in fact been continued. Both these lapses constitute inexcusable neglect amounting to a waiver of the hearing required by due process. Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co. v.

       The judgments of the Commission for the recovery of money, fines, or penalties shall be a lien on the real estate of the judgment debtor when duly docketed and indexed in the judgment lien docket, as the judgments of courts of record are required by law to be docketed and indexed, in the county or city in which the real estate of the judgment debtor is located, and the lien of any such judgment may be enforced in equity before any court having jurisdiction. The clerks of the courts of the several cities and counties shall docket all such judgments on the lien docket of their respective courts when a copy thereof, certified by the clerk of the Commission, shall be presented for that purpose.

     Appeal of right to Supreme Court.
    </b>
    - The Commonwealth, or any party in interest aggrieved by any final order of the State Corporation Commission, has an appeal of right to the Supreme Court. Howell v. SCC, <cite class="va_code">214 Va. 128</cite>, 198 S.E.2d 611 (1973).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     But the method of taking and prosecuting such an appeal must be in the manner prescribed
    </b>
    by law or by the Rules of the Supreme Court. Howell v. SCC, <cite class="va_code">214 Va. 128</cite>, 198 S.E.2d 611 (1973).
    <br/>
       </p>

     Final order needed.
    </b>
    - The Supreme Court of Virginia considers appeals from only final orders of the Commission. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council v. C &amp; P Tel. Co., <cite class="va_code">247 Va. 33</cite>, 443 S.E.2d 157 (1994).

     Sole method of review is by appeal as a rehearing by Commission is not allowed.
    </b>
    - The only remedy for review of the denial by the State Corporation Commission of the application for a certificate of public convenience as of right is by appeal to the Supreme Court within the time prescribed by
    
     §
    
    12.1-40. The right to a rehearing by the Commission is not granted. There may be cases subject to the continued supervisory control and direction of the Commission, notwithstanding they are no longer pending cases before the Commission, or where the inherent nature of the subject is such as to imply a right to reopen the case, or rehear a former adjudication. Reynolds v. Alexandria Motor Bus Line, <cite class="va_code">141 Va. 213</cite>, 126 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 201</cite> (1925).

        <b>
     Appeal may be taken from either judicial or ministerial proceeding.
    </b>
    - An appeal may be given either in a ministerial proceeding of the Corporation Commission or where the action is judicial. It is purely a question of intent, to be derived from the language of the General Assembly. Jones v. Rhea, <cite class="va_code">130 Va. 345</cite>, 107 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 814</cite> (1921).

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Test to be applied to determine who is entitled to appeal.
    </b>
    - The test to be applied to determine whether a person is entitled to appeal is, to ascertain whether he is a party (person) in interest. If he is, then he is as definitely given an appeal as the applicant in the proceedings. Jones v. Rhea, <cite class="va_code">130 Va. 345</cite>, 107 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 814</cite> (1921).

        <b>
     "Aggrieved" broader in scope than "party in interest."
    </b>
    - The term "aggrieved" as used in this section is broader in its scope than the term "party in interest." Commonwealth v. Sharp, <cite class="va_code">155 Va. 714</cite>, 156 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 570</cite> (1931); Virginia Ass'n of Ins. Agents v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">201 Va. 249</cite>, 110 S.E.2d 223 (1959).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Interest of party entitling him to appeal must be direct.
    </b>
    - In condemnation proceedings by a city to condemn land for a recreation park belonging to two railroads, appellants were citizens, taxpayers and owners of property adjacent to the property sought to be condemned. It was held that the interest which entitled a party to an appeal under this provision must be direct and not indirect and remote, and that the interest of appellants was not such an interest, but was indirect and remote. Page v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">157 Va. 325</cite>, 160 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 33</cite> (1931).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Rejected litigant, who is a proper party, is entitled to appeal.
    </b>
    - A litigant who seeks to become a party and is entitled to become a party to proceedings in which he is interested, and is erroneously rejected, should not be required to seek relief in a roundabout fashion by a distinct and separate suit, but should be regarded, for the purposes of appeal, as possessing the status of one who is a formal party to the proceedings in which his rights and interests are being litigated. Jones v. Rhea, <cite class="va_code">130 Va. 345</cite>, 107 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 814</cite> (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although minority members of one of several clubs merged by the Corporation Commission were not formal parties to the proceedings, they were entitled to an appeal under this section and former
    
     <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.08.html#t08c8-462" target="_blank">§
    
    8-462</a></cite> (see now

    8.01-670), especially where they had sought to become parties and their petition of intervention had been erroneously rejected by the Commission. Jones v. Rhea, <cite class="va_code">130 Va. 345</cite>, 107 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 814</cite> (1921).

        <b>
     Where a person was not a party to the proceeding, did not ask that he be made a party, or assert any interest therein,
    </b>
    he is not a "person interested," a "party in interest" in, or a "party aggrieved" by, an order of the State Corporation Commission revising liability insurance rates. Young v. SCC, <cite class="va_code">205 Va. 111</cite>, 135 S.E.2d 129 (1964).

     Corporations held to be applicants and entitled to appeal.
    </b>
    - The corporations concerned in merger, or dissolution proceedings, are certainly applicants and therefore apparently entitled to appeal. Jones v. Rhea, <cite class="va_code">130 Va. 345</cite>, 107 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 814</cite> (1921).

     Court cannot substitute its opinion for that of Commission.
    </b>
    - Where it was contended that this section should be construed as conferring legislative powers on the Supreme Court, and as authorizing it to substitute its opinion as to what was a proper rate for that of the Commission, it was held that this contention could not be accepted. It was further held that the language of the statute must be taken as referring to judicial powers, not those outside the normal field of appellate jurisdiction. Aetna Ins. Co. v.
