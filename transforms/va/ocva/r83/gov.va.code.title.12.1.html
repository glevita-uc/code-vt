        Editor's note.
       </b>
       - At its regular session of 1970, the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to undertake a general revision of the Code, with particular reference to amendments throughout the Code that would be necessary under the proposed revision of the Constitution of Virginia, subsequently adopted by the voters at the election held on November 3, 1970. In November of 1970 the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report, containing a proposed revision of Title 12, relating to the State Corporation Commission. This report, which was published as House Document No. 2 of the 1971 extra session, contains much valuable explanatory matter, which is, however, too lengthy for inclusion here. The Commission's draft of the revision of Title 12, as amended by the General Assembly, became Chapter 157 of the Acts of 1971, Extra Session. It repealed Title 12 of the Code, and enacted in lieu thereof a new Title 12.1.

       Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former law.

         Challenge to constitutionality of retirement system held properly dismissed.
        </b>
        - Suit brought by four former Virginia judges for a declaration that certain provisions of the Commonwealth's judicial retirement system covering them were unconstitutional, both under the equal protection clause of Amendment Fourteen of the Federal Constitution and under the Virginia Constitution, held properly dismissed.

         Virginia acted reasonably in setting up its recall system,

         Purpose of recall/retirement system.
        </b>
        - The clear purpose of the recall/retirement system is to insure the availability of a pool of auxiliary judges so that Virginia courts can more effectively address the problem of case backlogs. This system of benefits and burdens is rationally calculated to achieve this legitimate purpose; its general structure is well within any limitations imposed by the equal protection clause.

       <p class="p8">
        The Constitution and laws of this State which give to the State Corporation Commission control over common carriers of persons and goods in matters affecting their public duties and charges, require notice to such carriers, give them the most ample opportunity to be heard on all matters of law and fact which they may desire to allege or put forward in their defense, and in event of an adverse decision an appeal of right to the Supreme Court, regardless of the amount in controversy. Such legislation does not deprive them of their property without due process of law, and is not otherwise unconstitutional. Winchester & S.R.R. v. Commonwealth, 106 Va. 264, 55 S.E. 692 (1906).

         Fact that proposed regulation is not the same as final is not denial of due process.

         Notice and comment not required for discretionary determination.

        - Imposition of a threshold financial analysis by the State Corporation Commission in setting public utility rates does not constitute the promulgation of a rule or regulation of general application, which may be adopted by the commission only after notice and hearing. Application of the threshold standard is nothing more than a discretionary method of determining whether a rate change is needed. It is not a rule or regulation in the constitutional or statutory sense. Roanoke Gas Co. v. SCC, 225 Va. 186, 300 S.E.2d 785 (1983).

        - It is not reasonably conceivable that an attorney, exercising due care for his client's interests, would accept an equivocal statement that a staff member of the Securities Division of the State Corporation Commission would extend the order to show cause which had been set for hearing from one without any apparent authority and act upon the statement with complete confidence that a binding agreement had been reached concerning a continuance. Neither is it reasonably conceivable that, following his conversation with the staff member, the attorney would fail to contact the commission before the scheduled hearing date to ascertain whether the matter had in fact been continued. Both these lapses constitute inexcusable neglect amounting to a waiver of the hearing required by due process. Blinder, Robinson & Co. v.

        12.1-40. The right to a rehearing by the Commission is not granted. There may be cases subject to the continued supervisory control and direction of the Commission, notwithstanding they are no longer pending cases before the Commission, or where the inherent nature of the subject is such as to imply a right to reopen the case, or rehear a former adjudication.

         Appeal may be taken from either judicial or ministerial proceeding.

        - An appeal may be given either in a ministerial proceeding of the Corporation Commission or where the action is judicial. It is purely a question of intent, to be derived from the language of the General Assembly. Jones v. Rhea, 130 Va. 345, 107 S.E. 814 (1921).

         Test to be applied to determine who is entitled to appeal.
        </b>
        - The test to be applied to determine whether a person is entitled to appeal is, to ascertain whether he is a party (person) in interest. If he is, then he is as definitely given an appeal as the applicant in the proceedings. Jones v. Rhea, 130 Va. 345, 107 S.E. 814 (1921).

        - In condemnation proceedings by a city to condemn land for a recreation park belonging to two railroads, appellants were citizens, taxpayers and owners of property adjacent to the property sought to be condemned. It was held that the interest which entitled a party to an appeal under this provision must be direct and not indirect and remote, and that the interest of appellants was not such an interest, but was indirect and remote.

        - A litigant who seeks to become a party and is entitled to become a party to proceedings in which he is interested, and is erroneously rejected, should not be required to seek relief in a roundabout fashion by a distinct and separate suit, but should be regarded, for the purposes of appeal, as possessing the status of one who is a formal party to the proceedings in which his rights and interests are being litigated.
