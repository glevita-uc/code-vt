       ARTICLE I
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The purpose of this compact is to promote the better utilization of the fisheries, marine, shell and anadromous of the Atlantic seaboard by the development of a joint program for the promotion and protection of such fisheries, and by the prevention of the physical waste of the fisheries from any cause. It is not the purpose of this compact to authorize the states joining herein to limit the production of fish or fish products for the purpose of establishing or fixing the price thereof, or creating and perpetuating monopoly.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       ARTICLE II
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This agreement shall become operative immediately as to those states executing it whenever any two or more of the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida have executed it in the form that is in accordance with the laws of the executing state and the Congress has given its consent. Any state contiguous with any of the aforementioned states and riparian upon waters frequented by anadromous fish, flowing into waters under the jurisdiction of any of the aforementioned states, may become a party hereto as hereinafter provided.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       ARTICLE III
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Each state joining herein shall appoint three representatives to a Commission hereby constituted and designated as the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. One shall be the executive officer of the administrative agency of such state charged with the conservation of the fisheries resources to which this compact pertains or, if there be more than one officer or agency, the official of that state named by the governor thereof. The second shall be a member of the legislature of such state designated by the Commission or Committee on Interstate Cooperation of such state, or if there be none, or if said Commission on Interstate Cooperation cannot constitutionally designate the said member:
    such legislator shall be designated by the governor thereof; provided, that if it is constitutionally impossible to appoint a legislator as a commissioner from such state, the second member shall be appointed by the governor of said state in his discretion. The third shall be a citizen who shall have a knowledge of and interest in the marine fisheries problem, to be appointed by the governor.
    The Commission shall be a body corporate with the powers and duties set forth herein.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       ARTICLE IV
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The duty of the said Commission shall be to make inquiry and ascertain from time to time such methods, practices, circumstances and conditions as may be disclosed for bringing about the consideration of the prevention of the depletion and physical waste of the fisheries, marine, shell and anadromous, of the Atlantic seaboard. The Commission shall have power to recommend the coordination of the exercise of the police powers of the several states within their respective jurisdictions to promote the preservation of those fisheries and their protection against overfishing, waste, depletion or any abuse whatsoever and to assure a continuing yield from the fisheries resources of the aforementioned states.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       To that end the Commission shall draft and, after consultation with the Advisory Committee hereinafter authorized, recommend to the governors and legislatures of the various signatory states legislation dealing with the conservation of the marine, shell and anadromous fisheries of the Atlantic seaboard. The Commission shall, more than one month prior to any regular meeting of the legislature in any signatory state, present to the governor of the state its recommendations relating to enactments to be made by the legislature of that state in furthering the intents and purposes of this compact.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Commission shall consult with and advise the pertinent administrative agencies in the states party hereto with regard to problems connected with the fisheries and recommend the adoption of such regulations as it deems advisable.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Commission shall have power to recommend to the states party hereto the stocking of the waters of such states with fish and fish eggs, or joint stocking by some or all of the states party hereto, and when two or more of the states shall jointly stock waters the Commission shall act as the coordinating agency for such stocking.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       ARTICLE V
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Commission shall elect from its number a chairman and a vice-chairman and shall appoint and at its pleasure remove or discharge such officers and employees as may be required to carry the provision of this compact into effect, and shall fix and determine their duties, qualifications and compensation. Said Commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of its business. It may establish and maintain one or more offices for the transaction of its business and may meet at any time or place but must meet at least once a year.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       ARTICLE VI
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No action shall be taken by the Commission in regard to its general affairs except by the affirmative vote of a majority of the whole number of compacting states present at any meeting. No recommendation shall be made by the Commission in regard to any species of fish except by the affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states which have an interest in such species. The Commission shall define what shall be an interest.

       <br/>
       <br/>

       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior of the Government of the United States shall act as the primary research agency of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, cooperating with the research agencies in each state for that purpose. Representatives of the said Fish and Wildlife Service shall attend the meetings of the Commission.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       An Advisory Committee to be representative of the commercial fishermen and the salt water anglers and such other interest of each state as the Commission deems advisable shall be established by the Commission as soon as practicable for the purpose of advising the Commission upon such recommendations as it may desire to make.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       ARTICLE VIII
       <br/>
       <br/>
       When any state other than those named specifically in Article II of this compact shall become a party thereto for the purpose of conserving its anadromous fish in accordance with the provisions of Article II the participation of such state in the action of the Commission shall be limited to such species of anadromous fish.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       ARTICLE IX
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit the powers of any signatory state or to repeal or prevent the enactment of any legislation or the enforcement of any requirement by any signatory state imposing additional conditions and restrictions to conserve its fisheries.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       ARTICLE X
       <br/>

       Continued absence of representation or of any representative on the Commission from any state party hereto shall be brought to the attention of the governor thereof.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       ARTICLE XI
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The states party hereto agree to make annual appropriations to the support of the Commission in proportion to the primary market value of the products of their fisheries, exclusive of cod and haddock, as recorded in the most recent published reports of the Fish and Wildlife Service of the United States Department of the Interior, provided no state shall contribute less than two hundred dollars per annum and the annual contribution of each state above the minimum shall be figured to the nearest one hundred dollars.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The compacting states agree to appropriate initially the annual amounts scheduled below, which amounts are calculated in the manner set forth herein, on the basis of the catch record of 1938.

       AMENDMENT NUMBER 1
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The states consenting to this amendment agree that any two or more of them may designate the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission as joint regulatory agency with such powers as they may jointly confer from time to time for the regulation of the fishing operations of the citizens and vessels of such designating states with respect to specific fisheries in which such states have a common interest.
    The representatives of such states on the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission shall constitute a separate section of such Commission for the exercise of the additional powers so granted provided that the states so acting shall appropriate additional funds for this purpose. The creation of such section as a joint regulatory agency shall not deprive the states participating therein of any of their privileges or powers or responsibilities in the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission under the general compact.

       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, certain provisions of the Compact of 1785 between Maryland and Virginia having become obsolete, Maryland and Virginia each recognizing that Maryland is the owner of the Potomac River bed and waters to the low-water mark of the southern shore thereof, as laid out on the Mathews-Nelson Survey of 1927, and that Virginia is the owner of the Potomac River bed and waters southerly from said low-water mark as laid out, and that the citizens of Virginia have certain riparian rights along the southern shore of the river, as shown on said Mathews-Nelson Survey, and, in common with the citizens of Maryland, the right of fishing in said river, Maryland and Virginia have agreed that the necessary conservation and improvement of the Tidewater portion of the Potomac fishery resources can be best achieved by a Commission comprised of representatives of both Maryland and Virginia, charged with the establishment and maintenance of a program to conserve and improve these resources, and

       Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commissioners appointed by the Governors of the State of Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia, meeting in joint session, that they do unanimously recommend to the said respective Governors that there be a new compact, to be designated as the "Potomac River Compact of 1958," and that the said new compact be referred as promptly as possible to the legislatures of the State of Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia for appropriate action, and to the end and after ratification and adoption by said legislatures the same be submitted to the Congress of the United States for approval.

         Regulation of water withdrawal and waterway construction.
        </b>
        - The drafters of the 1785 Compact carefully delineated the instances in which the citizens of one State would be subject to the regulatory authority of the other; furthermore, the Black-Jenkins Award gives Virginia sovereign authority, free from regulation by Maryland, to build improvements appurtenant to her shore and to withdraw water from the river, subject to the constraints of federal common law and the Award. Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 124 S. Ct. 598, 157 L. Ed. 2d 461, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 9192 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Maryland has asserted a right to regulate Virginia's water withdrawal for, at most, 43 years, and a right to regulate waterway construction for, at most, 32 years, but even assuming such a short prescriptive period would be adequate to overcome a sovereign right, Maryland's claim fails because it has not proved Virginia's acquiescence, since Virginia vigorously protested Maryland's asserted authority. Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 124 S. Ct. 598, 157 L. Ed. 2d 461, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 9192 (2003).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        Maryland: Article IX of the Potomac River Compact of 1958 states that it shall take effect "sixty days after the completion of the last act legally necessary to make it operative, and thereupon the said Compact of 1785 shall no longer have any force and effect"; consequently, the Maryland-Virginia Compact of 1785 was abrogated on January 7, 1961, sixty days after ratification of the Compact of 1958 by voters in a general election. Brown v. Bowles, 254 Md. 377, 254 A.2d 696 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power of states to make compacts, i.e., to contract with each other by statute, is a power inherent in state sovereignty, and its only limitation is the requirement of Congressional consent found in Article I, Section 10, of the Constitution of the United States. Dutton v. Tawes, 225 Md. 484, 171 A.2d 688 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Maryland-Virginia Compact of 1785 required that all laws and regulations necessary for the preservation of fish in the Potomac river be made with the consent of both states; however, based on context and a reading of the Compact
        in toto
        , this requirement did not apply to the upper, unnavigable portion of the river. As a result, Maryland statute prohibiting certain kinds of fishing in the upper Potomac was valid as enacted, and approval by the Virginia Legislature was not required. Middlekauff v. LeCompte, 149 Md. 621, 132 A. 48 (1926).
