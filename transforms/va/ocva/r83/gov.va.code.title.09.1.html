        - In a proceeding to terminate parental rights, it was not error to allow a former court appointed special advocate to testify whether she believed the child should be returned to the mother since such testimony did not intrude on the trial court's obligation to decide whether to terminate the mother's parental rights.

The Plans shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and shall be modeled upon state employee health benefits program plans.

        <br/>
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p class="p8">
       It is the intent of the General Assembly that expeditious payments for burial expenses be made for deceased persons whose death is determined to be a direct and proximate result of their performance in the line of duty as defined by the Line of Duty Act. Upon the approval of VRS, at the request of the family of a person who may be subject to the line of duty death benefits, payments shall be made to a funeral service provider for burial and transportation costs by the nonparticipating employer or from the Fund on behalf of a participating employer, as applicable. These payments would be advanced from the death benefit that would be due to the beneficiary of the deceased person if it is determined that the person qualifies for line of duty coverage. Expenses advanced under this provision shall not exceed the coverage amounts outlined in § 65.2-512. In the event a determination is made that the death is not subject to the line of duty benefits, VRS or other Virginia governmental retirement fund of which the deceased is a member will deduct from benefit payments otherwise due to be paid to the beneficiaries of the deceased payments previously paid for burial and related transportation expenses and return such funds to the nonparticipating employer or to the Fund on behalf of a participating employer, as applicable. The Virginia Retirement System shall have the right to file a claim with the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission against any employer to recover burial and related transportation expenses advanced under this provision.

        9.1-900, unlike Connecticut's statute, made an offender's dangerousness a material part of the statute, the cases were not distinguishable on that ground because the United States Supreme Court had recognized that the Connecticut statute was likewise designed to protect its communities from sex offenders.

In making its determination, the court shall consider all of the following factors that are relevant to the case: (i) the degree to which the delinquent act was committed with the use of force, threat, or intimidation, (ii) the age and maturity of the complaining witness, (iii) the age and maturity of the offender, (iv) the difference in the ages of the complaining witness and the offender, (v) the nature of the relationship between the complaining witness and the offender, (vi) the offender's prior criminal history, and (vii) any other aggravating or mitigating factors relevant to the case. The attorney for the Commonwealth may file such a motion at any time during which the offender is within the jurisdiction of the court for the offense that is the basis for such motion.

When such a determination is required, the court shall advise the defendant of its determination and of the defendant's right to make a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere pursuant to § 19.2-296. If the court grants the defendant's motion to withdraw his plea of guilty or of nolo contendere, his case shall be heard by another judge, unless the parties agree otherwise.

        - Circuit court properly convicted defendant in a bench trial of failing to register his social media account information with law enforcement because the statutory scheme unquestionably advanced a significant governmental interest and any burden it placed on defendant's First Amendment rights of speech and association was minimal to non-existent, neither statute prohibited or regulated the content of speech or prevented defendant from accessing or using any Internet site, they simply required that he make his online identity and whereabouts known to law enforcement, and the existence of the penalty did not "chill" him sufficiently to stop either the speech or other associative acts in which he sought to engage on the Internet.

Regardless of the applicability of SORNA to defendant as of the dates in question, the nature of his conviction required him, under a long-standing federal law, to register in his state of residence and any other state where he was employed, carried on a vocation, or was a student, 42 U.S.C.S.

         2007 amendment does not transform civil remedy into criminal penalty.
        </b>
        - 2007 amendment to the statute does not transform a civil remedy into a criminal penalty because a requirement to report email addresses to law enforcement does not involve the real-time public display for ridicule and shaming that defined historical punishments; while the requirement to register new email addresses does impose some limitation, it does not subject individuals to an affirmative disability or restraint. Baugh v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 437, 809 S.E.2d 247 (2018).
       </p>
       <p class="p9">
        2007 amendment to the statute does not transform a civil remedy into a criminal penalty because although requiring a defendant to register new email addresses with law enforcement may have a deterrent effect, any such deterrence, if it exists at all, is relatively minor. Baugh v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 437, 809 S.E.2d 247 (2018).
       </p>
       <p class="p9">
        2007 amendment to the statute has a rational connection to a legitimate, non-punitive purpose, public safety, which is advanced by law enforcement having the ability to monitor the online communication of offenders; requiring offenders to identify email addresses through registration reasonably relates to the Commonwealth's interests in improving the ability of law enforcement to protect the public, where a high rate of recidivism among convicted sex offenders poses a real concern. Baugh v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 437, 809 S.E.2d 247 (2018).
       </p>
       <p class="p9">
        Enabling law enforcement to determine whether offenders are using email addresses to communicate with potential victims has a definite rational connection to a non-punitive purpose, even the majority of email addresses have a non-public use; it is rational to conclude that a public safety goal is advanced by law enforcement agencies having an offender's email address. Baugh v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 437, 809 S.E.2d 247 (2018).
       </p>
       <p class="p9">
        2007 amendment to the statute is not excessive with respect to the Virginia Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry Act's non-punitive purpose, as it allows for electronic re-registration of an email address rather than requiring in-person reporting; an offender can register either in person or electronically. Baugh v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 437, 809 S.E.2d 247 (2018).
       </p>
       <p class="p9">
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment charging him with failure to register as a sex offender because defendant did not demonstrate by the clearest proof that the 2007 amendment to the statute transformed a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.

         Review.

        - Court of appeals declined to consider the effect of certain amendments on the Virginia Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry Act because the amendments did not serve as the basis for defendant's conviction, and thus, any discussion of their impact on defendant would be speculative; defendant himself represented to the trial court that the sole issue before it was the application of the 2007 amendment requiring email registration.

        - Court of appeals declined to consider the effect of certain amendments on the Virginia Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry Act because the amendments did not serve as the basis for defendant's conviction, and thus, any discussion of their impact on defendant would be speculative; defendant himself represented to the trial court that the sole issue before it was the application of the 2007 amendment requiring email registration.

        Upon expiration of three years from the date upon which the duty to register as a Tier III offender or murderer is imposed, the person required to register may petition the court in which he was convicted or, if the conviction occurred outside of the Commonwealth, the circuit court in the jurisdiction where he currently resides, for relief from the requirement to verify his registration information four times each year at three-month intervals. After five years from the date of his last conviction for a violation of § 18.2-472.1, a Tier III offender or murderer may petition for relief from the requirement to verify his registration information every month. A person who is required to register may similarly petition the circuit court for relief from the requirement to verify his registration twice each year after five years from the date of his last conviction for a violation of § 18.2-472.1. The court shall hold a hearing on the petition, on notice to the attorney for the Commonwealth, to determine whether the person suffers from a mental abnormality or a personality disorder that makes the person a menace to the health and safety of others or significantly impairs his ability to control his sexual behavior. Prior to the hearing the court shall order a comprehensive assessment of the applicant by a panel of three certified sex offender treatment providers as defined in § 54.1-3600. A report of the assessment shall be filed with the court prior to the hearing. The costs of the assessment shall be taxed as costs of the proceeding.

        The duly appointed guardian of a person convicted of an offense requiring registration, reregistration, or verification of his registration information as either a Tier I, Tier II, or Tier III offender or murderer, who due to a physical condition is incapable of (i) reoffending and (ii) reregistering or verifying his registration information, may petition the court in which the person was convicted for relief from the requirement to reregister or verify his registration information. The court shall hold a hearing on the petition, on notice to the attorney for the Commonwealth, to determine whether the person suffers from a physical condition that makes the person (i) no longer a menace to the health and safety of others and (ii) incapable of reregistering or verifying his registration information.

       Any material that is seized in any criminal investigation and that is deemed to be hazardous to health and safety, may be disposed of upon written application of the Department to the attorney for the Commonwealth in the city or county where the material is seized or where any criminal prosecution in which the material is proposed to be evidence is pending. Upon receipt thereof, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall file the application in the circuit court of such county or city. A sworn analysis report signed by a person designated by the Director of the Department shall accompany the application for disposal and shall clearly identify and designate the material to be disposed of. The application shall state the nature of the hazardous materials, the quantity thereof, the location where seized, the person from whom the materials were seized, and the manner whereby the materials shall be destroyed.

A return under oath, reporting the time, place, and manner of destruction, shall be made to the courts. Copies of the analysis report, application, order, and return shall be made a part of the record of any criminal prosecution. The sworn analysis report shall be admissible as evidence to the same extent as the disposed-of material would have been admissible.

Notice shall be by certified mail. The court, within 30 days after receipt of the notice, may direct that the property be disposed of by the Department, by an alternative method designed to preserve the property, at the expense of the agency submitting the property to the Department.

        A certifying official shall (i) respond to requests for completion of certification forms received by the agency, as required by this section, and (ii) make information regarding the agency's procedures for certification requests publicly available for victims of qualifying criminal activity and their representatives.
       </li>
       <li class="p8" id="Nones9.1-1501ol1B">
        Any person seeking completion of a certification form shall first submit a request for completion of the certification form to any certifying official for the certifying agency that detected, investigated, or prosecuted the criminal activity upon which the request is based.
       </li>
       <li class="p8" id="Nones9.1-1501ol1C">
        A request for completion of a certification form under this section may be submitted by the victim of qualifying criminal activity or a representative of the person seeking the certification form. Such representative of the person may include an attorney, a licensed clinical social worker, a guardian ad litem, or an employee of a crime victim and witness assistance program or a domestic violence or sexual assault services provider.
       </li>
       <li class="p8" id="Nones9.1-1501ol1D">
        Upon receiving a request for completion of a certification form, a certifying official shall provide a response to the request within 120 days. Within such time, the certifying official shall complete the certification except (i) if the person making the request for completion of the certification form is in federal immigration removal proceedings or detained, the certifying official shall complete and provide the certification form to the person no later than 21 business days after the request is received by the certifying agency; (ii) if the twenty-first birthdate of the applicant's children or the eighteenth birthdate of the applicant's sibling is within 120 days of the date of the request, the certifying official shall respond within 30 days; (iii) if the person's children, parents, or siblings under clause (ii) would become ineligible for benefits under 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p) and 1184(o) in less than 21 business days of receipt of the certification request, the certifying official shall complete and provide a certification form to the person within seven days; or (iv) a certifying official may extend the time period by which it must complete and provide the certification form to the person as required under this subsection upon written agreement with the person or person's representative. If the certifying official cannot determine whether the applicant is a victim of qualifying criminal activity or determines that the applicant does not qualify, the certifying official shall provide a written explanation to the person or the person's representative setting forth reasons why the available evidence does not support a finding that the person is a victim of qualifying criminal activity.

        A certifying official who issued an initial certification form shall complete and reissue a certification form within 90 business days of receiving a request from a victim to reissue the certification form. If the victim seeking recertification has a deadline to respond to a request for evidence from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the certifying official shall complete and issue the form no later than 21 business days after the request is received by the certifying official. Requests for expedited recertification shall be affirmatively raised by the victim or victim's representative in writing and shall establish that the victim is eligible for expedited review. A certifying official may extend the deadline by which he will complete and reissue the certification form only upon written agreement with the victim or victim's representative.

       <li class="p8" id="Nones9.1-1501ol1F">
        Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a certifying official's completion of a certification form shall not be considered sufficient evidence that an applicant for a U or T visa has met all eligibility requirements for that visa, and completion of a certification form by a certifying official shall not be construed to guarantee that the victim will receive federal immigration relief. It is the exclusive responsibility of federal immigration officials to determine whether a person is eligible for a U or T visa. Completion of a certification form by a certifying official merely verifies factual information relevant to the federal immigration benefit sought, including information relevant for federal immigration officials to determine eligibility for a U or T visa. By completing a certification form, the certifying official attests that the information is true and correct to the best of the certifying official's knowledge. No provision in this chapter limits the manner in which a certifying official or certifying agency may describe whether the person has cooperated or been helpful to the agency or provide any additional information the certifying official or certifying agency believes might be relevant to a federal immigration officer's adjudication of a U or T visa application. If, after completion of a certification form, the certifying official later determines that the person was not the victim of qualifying criminal activity or the victim unreasonably refuses to assist in the investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity of which he is a victim, the certifying official may notify United States Citizenship and Immigration Services in writing.

        A certifying official or agency receiving requests for completion of certification forms shall not disclose the immigration status of a victim or person requesting the certification form, except to comply with federal or state law or a legal process or if authorized by the victim or person requesting the certification form.

The circuit court shall conduct an evidentiary hearing on such petition within 30 days of the filing of the petition. Upon conducting a hearing and the circuit court being satisfied that the applicant having proven their eligibility for completion of a certification form by a preponderance of the evidence and the circuit court having found that the certifying agency's refusal to sign was unreasonable, a circuit court judge may execute the certification form. In assessing the reasonableness of the certifying agency's decision or failure to respond, the circuit court may consider whether the applicant has complied with the terms of this section and whether circumstances exist that would justify a deferral of a decision including whether a certification would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation or prosecution or the safety of an individual, cause a suspect to flee or evade detection, result in the destruction of evidence, or the applicant's cooperation is not complete.
