    is given in Straley v. Esser, <cite class="va_code">117 Va. 135</cite>, 83 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 1075</cite> (1915). Its purpose was to change the law as declared in Floyd v. Harding, 69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 401 (1877), and subsequent cases following the doctrine that a purchaser under a parol contract who had paid the purchase money and had been put in possession of the land had a valid equitable title not subject to the lien of a subsequent judgment creditor of the vendor. See Barnes v. American Fertilizer Co., <cite class="va_code">144 Va. 692</cite>, 130 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 902</cite> (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the objects of
    
     §
    
    2463 of the Code of 1887 (similar to this section) was to place a purchaser of land under a parol contract, as to purchasers for valuable consideration without notice and creditors, in the same condition as purchasers under a writing who had failed to record it as provided by
    <span class="s1">
     §§
    </span>

       </p>
       <p>
        This section is not directly related to
        §
        17 of the English Statute of Frauds, but was enacted in 1887 to rectify an odd development in Virginia's recording laws which had put a purchaser of land under an unrecorded oral contract in a stronger position than a purchaser of land under an unrecorded written contract. Stein v. Pulaski Furn. Corp., 217 F. Supp. 587 (W.D. Va. 1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The anomalous condition of the law, by which a parol agreement for a lien took precedence of subsequent judgment liens, while a written unrecorded mortgage did not, was remedied by
        §
        2463 of the Code of 1887. Page v. Old Dominion Trust Co., 257 F. 402 (4th Cir. 1919).

        <b>
         Oral agreement for sale of real estate.
        </b>
        - Where debtors in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy purportedly sold property to a purchaser prior to the bankruptcy filing pursuant to an oral agreement, although the debtors and the purchaser produced several documents to support the existence of their contract, the parties never recorded their transaction for the property, and the bankruptcy court determined that the oral, unrecorded contract was invalid; thus, pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S.
        §
        544(a)(3) the Trustee took legal title to the property, but the purchaser had an equitable interest in the property in the form of a constructive trust in the amount of $31,600.00 - the amount the purchaser had paid towards the sales price. Lubman v. Wells (In re Wells), 296 Bankr. 728, 2003 Bankr. LEXIS 884 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a suit between individuals to set aside as a fraudulent conveyance a deed of trust regarding certain real property, where an intervenor bank did not have a claim to this property by an equitable lien from its possession and a certain contract regarding the property, even if the bank had an equitable interest in the property, its interest was junior to that of the parties because it failed to comply with state recording statutes, and under
    
     <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.11.html#t11c01s11-1" target="_self">§

    55-96, a contract conveying property was void as to all bona fide purchasers or creditors without notice of it until it was recorded. Hung-Lin Wu

    - A contract which provides for an actual demise of real estate for two years and one month, with the privilege to the lessee at his option of four successive renewals, each for a period of one year, is a contract for a term of more than five years in real estate within the meaning of this section, and as against a subsequent purchaser for value and without notice must, under
    
     §
    
    55-96, be recorded. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. Cofer, <cite class="va_code">129 Va. 640</cite>, 106 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 695</cite> (1921).

     This section has no application to resulting trusts.
    </b>
    - Where one holds a legal title to real estate which is impressed in his hands with a resulting trust, such trust may be enforced and is good against his judgment creditors. A different rule prevails where it is sought to set up by parol a resulting trust against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice. Savings &amp; Loan Corp. v. Bear, <cite class="va_code">155 Va. 312</cite>, 154 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 587</cite> (1930), citing Ransome v. Watson, <cite class="va_code">145 Va. 669</cite>, 134 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 707</cite> (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section has no application to resulting trusts arising from the payment of the purchase money by one party while the conveyance is to another, and a judgment against the trustee does not bind the beneficial interest. Straley v. Esser, <cite class="va_code">117 Va. 135</cite>, 83 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 1075</cite> (1915).

    - The provision of this section that contracts not in writing, for the conveyance or sale of real estate, shall be void as to purchasers for value, does not apply to contracts embodied in valid decrees entered by courts of equity.

        </h5>
        <p>
         <b>
     The statute of frauds set out in this section is a wise and salutary law,
    </b>
    and should be fairly and fully carried into execution by the courts. Cutler v. Hinton, 27 Va. (6 Rand.) 509 (1828). See Wright v. Pucket, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 370 (1872); Plunkett v. Bryant, <cite class="va_code">101 Va. 814</cite>, 45 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 742</cite> (1903).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Its object is to prevent frauds and perjuries,
    </b>
    and not to perpetrate them, and the statute is never enforced when by the effect of it a fraud and a wrong would be perpetrated. Wheat v. Wheat, 3 Va. L. Reg. (n.s.) 177, aff'd by divided court, <cite class="va_code">119 Va. 861</cite>, 91 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 827</cite> (1916); T. . . v. T. . ., <cite class="va_code">216 Va. 867</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 148 (1976).
        </p>
        <p>
         It was not intended that the statute should perpetrate frauds. Its primary object is to prevent the setting up of pretended agreements and then supporting them by perjury. Wright v. Pucket, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 370 (1872); Plunkett v. Bryant, <cite class="va_code">101 Va. 814</cite>, 45 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 742</cite> (1903); Reynolds v. Dixon, <cite class="va_code">187 Va. 101</cite>, 46 S.E.2d 6 (1948).
        </p>
        <p>
         The statute will not be applied when the result is to cause a fraud or perpetrate a wrong, because the object of the statute is to prevent frauds. Murphy v. Nolte &amp; Co., <cite class="va_code">226 Va. 76</cite>, 307 S.E.2d 242 (1983).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     And it manifests the policy of requiring certain contracts to be in writing.
    </b>
    - The statute manifests the policy of requiring contracts of an important nature, such as the sale and purchase of real estate, to be reduced to writing, since otherwise, from the imperfection of memory and the honest mistakes of witnesses, it often happens either that the specific contract is incapable of exact proof or that it is unintentionally varied from its original terms. Wright v. Pucket, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 370 (1872); Plunkett v. Bryant, <cite class="va_code">101 Va. 814</cite>, 45 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 742</cite> (1903); Reynolds v.

     The purposes of this section
    </b>
    are to provide reliable evidence of the existence and terms of certain types of contracts and to reduce the likelihood that contracts within the scope of this statute can be created or altered by acts of perjury or fraud. Lindsay v. McEnearney Assocs., <cite class="va_code">260 Va. 48</cite>, 531 S.E.2d 573 (2000).

     Modification must also be in writing.
    </b>
    - When a contract is required to be in writing pursuant to this section, any modification of that contract must also be in writing and signed by the party to be charged or his agent. Lindsay v. McEnearney Assocs., <cite class="va_code">260 Va. 48</cite>, 531 S.E.2d 573 (2000).

          This section deals only with the legal enforceability and not with the substantive validity of oral agreements
         </b>
         which fall within its scope. Stein v. Pulaski Furn. Corp., 217 F. Supp. 587 (W.D. Va. 1963).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section is not concerned with the validity of the contract but merely with its enforceability. Brown v. Valentine, 240 F. Supp. 539 (W.D. Va. 1965).
        </p>
        <p>
         The statute is procedural or remedial in nature, and is concerned not with the validity of the contract, but with its enforceability. T. . . v. T. . ., <cite class="va_code">216 Va. 867</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 148 (1976); Murphy v. Nolte &amp; Co., <cite class="va_code">226 Va. 76</cite>, 307 S.E.2d 242 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         The statute of frauds is concerned with the enforceability of contracts, not their validity. Because its object is to prevent fraud, it will not be applied when to do so would result in a fraud or perpetrate a wrong. Troyer v. Troyer, <cite class="va_code">231 Va. 90</cite>, 341 S.E.2d 182 (1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the parol evidence rule, the merger clause in guaranty agreements with the creditor bank precluded the introduction into evidence of alleged oral agreements between the creditor and the guarantors that would change the nature of the contract between the parties to advance funds and release certain property of the debtor. The statute of frauds was not applicable. Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Dresdner (In re Brookland Park Plaza, LLC),, 2009 Bankr. LEXIS 3241 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Oct. 13, 2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no prohibition in this section on the ability of third-party beneficiaries to sue upon oral contracts generally.

     To escape statute of frauds.
    </b>
    - The controlling principles are well settled. To escape the statute of frauds, the oral agreement must be definite, certain, and unequivocal in all its terms. Certainty means that each term is expressed in an exact manner; by contrast, uncertainty means that terms are expressed inexactly, indefinitely, and obscurely so that the intent is not ascertainable. Further, the acts the plaintiff relied on to establish part performance must be consistent with no theory other than the existence of an oral contract. Finally, the agreement must be so far executed that a refusal to require full execution would operate as a fraud upon the plaintiff. Beach v. Virginia Nat'l Bank, <cite class="va_code">235 Va. 376</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 516 (1988).

        <p>
         <b>
     Purpose of statute.
    </b>
    - The clause of the statute relating to an agreement to answer for the debt of another contemplates a gratuitous verbal promise by one to pay a debt which he does not owe, and is not liable for, but which is owed by another; and the intent and purpose of the statute is to compel the reduction to writing of the evidence of such voluntary promise, for the protection, alike, of promisor and promisee from fraud. Skinker v. Armstrong, <cite class="va_code">86 Va. 1011</cite>, 11 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 977</cite> (1890).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     No shield against actual debt of promisor.
    </b>
    - The statute contemplates the mere promise of one man to be responsible for another, and cannot be interposed as a shield against the actual obligations of the promisor. Alessandrini v. Mullins, <cite class="va_code">178 Va. 69</cite>, 16 S.E.2d 323 (1941).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     For the statute to apply
    </b>
    it is essential that the oral promise be to perform the same duty or obligation which rests upon another person. In other words, the oral promisor must have undertaken to discharge the same obligation or debt which another person has undertaken to discharge. Planters Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Loe, <cite class="va_code">193 Va. 411</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 455 (1952).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Elements.
    </b>
    - With respect to a guaranty agreement, the statute of frauds requires that the nature and extent of the undertaking, including the promise to pay the debt of another, appear on the face of the writing or the agreement is not enforceable. These essential terms of the agreement must be obvious on the face of the writing without recourse to parol evidence. Janus v. Sproul, <cite class="va_code">250 Va. 90</cite>, 458 S.E.2d 300 (1995).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Agreement need not be shown.
    </b>
    - The statute does not require that a writing evidencing a promise to pay the debt of another shall show on its face the agreement between the parties in order to be valid, but only that the promise to answer for the debt of another, or some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing. Saunders v. Bank of Mecklenburg, <cite class="va_code">112 Va. 443</cite>, 71 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 714</cite> (1911).

        <p>
         <b>
          No request necessary.
         </b>
         - In order for the promise of one person to pay the debt of another to be binding, it is not necessary that it should be made at the request of the person whose debt the promisor assumes or at the request of the creditor. Colgin v. Henley, 33 Va. (6 Leigh) 85 (1835).
         <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Guarantee must be in writing.
    </b>
    - Because any action brought to impose liability for a guaranty agreement would seek to charge the purported guarantor upon a promise to answer for the debt of another, the statute of frauds requires that the agreement be in writing and signed by the guarantor. American Indus. Corp. v. First &amp; Merchants Nat'l Bank, <cite class="va_code">216 Va. 396</cite>, 219 S.E.2d 673 (1975).

          Consideration is necessary.

         - Under the statute the consideration need not be expressed in the written promise to pay the debt of another. Colgin v. Henley, 33 Va. (6 Leigh) 85 (1835).
        </p>
        <p>
         Plaintiff, in declaring on promise of defendant to pay the debt of another, alleged a particular consideration, but the written promise of defendant adduced in evidence contained no mention of the consideration. It was held that this was no variance between the allegata and probata, the written promise was proper evidence, and the consideration was provable by evidence aliunde. Colgin v. Henley, 33 Va.

        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Consideration must be a direct benefit to promisor.
    </b>
    - The kind of benefit that takes the promise out of the statute is one which the promisor receives or expects to receive when he makes the promise, resulting in an original, independent undertaking by the promisor. The consideration for the promise must be a direct benefit to the promisor and the primary object of making the promise, as distinguished from a benefit which is merely incidental, indirect or remote.

    - In determining whether an alleged promise is or is not a promise to answer for the debt of another, no particular form of words is necessary to show an original promise or conclusion as to the intention of the parties, and the circumstances of each case must be taken into consideration. Southside Brick Works v. Anderson, <cite class="va_code">147 Va. 566</cite>, 137 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 371</cite> (1927); Parksley Nat'l Bank v.

        </p>
        <p>
         The real character of the promise does not depend altogether upon the words or form of expression used, but largely upon the situation of the parties and what they mutually understood from the language, whether they understood the transaction to be a direct or a collateral promise.

        </p>
        <p>
         Whether an undertaking is collateral and governed by the statute of frauds or direct and exempt from the statute is not to be judged by the unilateral intent of the promisor but by the mutual understanding between the promisor and promisee.

    - If evidence taken shows that individual defendants, or any of them, affixed their signatures and seals to a lease with the intent to be bound by its terms, it must be determined whether the undertaking of the signers, or any of them, was a primary obligation, which would not be within the statute of frauds, or a collateral undertaking guaranteeing the performance of the obligations of the lessee, which would be within the statute of frauds and must be supported by a written promise.

Complainant relied upon an oral statement made to him by defendant that "she would never see him lose anything and would never plead the statute of limitations against said note, and that she would pay it."

         A verbal promise before marriage to make a gift of personal property to a daughter in consideration of the marriage cannot be enforced by the husband, either against the father or the creditors; and if voluntarily executed by the father after the marriage, is void against all existing creditors.

But if the trees are to be severed immediately, or within a reasonable or convenient time, with a mere license to enter and take them away, without any stipulation for the beneficial use meanwhile of the soil, it is a sale of goods, and need not be in writing.

Seddon v. Rosenbaum, <cite class="va_code">85 Va. 928</cite>, 9 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 326</cite> (1889); Thomas v.

        <p>
         As to distinction between "an agreement that is not to be performed within a year" and "an agreement which is not to be defeated within a year," see Seddon v. Rosenbaum, <cite class="va_code">85 Va. 928</cite>, 9 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 326</cite> (1889).
        </p>

         A writing is not needed so long as the contract can be performed within a year, even if only by some improbable event. Frazier v. Colonial Williamsburg Found., 574 F. Supp. 318 (E.D. Va. 1983).

          Detrimental reliance/promissory estoppel assertion.
         </b>
         - Although under this section, an agreement which cannot be performed within one year is unenforceable unless it is in writing and signed by the party to be charged, a party may assert equitable estoppel against a statute of frauds defense, even in the absence of actual fraud, if he can prove "that the person to be estopped has misled another to his prejudice ... or that the innocent party acted in reliance upon the conduct or misstatement by the person to be estopped." Tidewater Beverage Servs., Inc. v. Coca Cola Co., 907 F. Supp. 943 (E.D. Va. 1995).

        </p>
        <p>
         In other words, the agreement must contemplate nonperformance by both parties within the year in order to fall within subdivision 7 (now subdivision 8) of the statute. And deferred payments do not change the situation. Smith v. Payne, <cite class="va_code">153 Va. 746</cite>, 151 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 295</cite> (1930); Greenbrier Farms v.

         Oral agreement under which plaintiff agreed to give defendant cuttings and grafts from plaintiff's prized camellia bush for the purpose of growing and marketing plants therefrom and defendant agreed to pay a royalty or commission on each plant was not within subdivision 7 (now subdivision 8) of this section as one not to be performed within a year.

          Oral modifications had to be in writing.
         </b>
         - Partners and former partners' assertion that the parties orally modified their written agreement did not sufficiently raise an issue that precluded summary judgment to the partnership as to liability on its claims, arising from the allegedly unlawful withdrawal of partnership funds, as any oral modifications were not valid or enforceable under both Virginia and Mississippi law because the original contract had to be in writing due to the time of performance.

     Termination by operation of law absent provision for full performance.

    - Where the plaintiff's employment contract would terminate by operation of law upon the plaintiff's death or resignation, and it would terminate by breach upon his discharge for cause, because the plaintiff's contract contained no provision providing for full performance in the event of those contingencies within one year, the statute of frauds was applicable.

     Party must rely on own acts of part performance.
    </b>
    - A party seeking to avoid the bar of the statute of frauds must rely upon his own acts of part performance rather than the conduct of others, and the acts relied on as part performance must be consistent with no theory other than the existence of the alleged oral contract. Said differently, those acts must be such as could be done with no other view or design than to perform the agreement. Williams v. Heller Bros.

It was held that this contract was a lease and not an agreement for lease, and being an executed contract, was not affected by subdivision 7 (now subdivision 8) of the statute. Smith v.

         An agreement to leave a person a support after the death of the promisor in consideration of services to be rendered by the promisee during the balance of the promisor's life, full performance of the contract being dependent upon a contingency that may happen within a year, is not within the statute.

         When it appears by the whole tenor of an agreement not in writing that it is to be performed after the first year, then the contract is within the statute and must be in writing.

     Promise to pay debt of another.

    - This section does not require that a writing evidencing a promise to pay the debts of another shall show on its face the agreement between the parties in order to be valid, but only that the promise to answer for the debt of another, or some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing. A negotiable note made by third persons and given to the creditor, as collateral security for, or in part payment of, a debt due by another is a sufficient compliance with the statute. Saunders v.

        </p>
        <p>
         It is not essential that the memorandum be signed with intent to comply with the statute. Whether a memorandum was signed with the thought of actually executing the instrument, or merely to receipt for money in furtherance of the contract, is immaterial. Horner v. Holt, <cite class="va_code">187 Va. 715</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 365 (1948).
        </p>
        <p>
         A memorandum may be signed, within the meaning of the statute of frauds, by writing the name anywhere in the instrument, whether at the top, in the middle or at the bottom thereof, but wherever the name be placed, it must appear to have been done with the intention of authenticating the instrument and not for some other purpose, for a signing consists of both the act of writing a person's name and the intention in doing this, to execute and authenticate the instrument signed. Hence, the mere writing by a proposed purchaser of an agreement for the sale and purchase of real estate, containing the names of the parties at the beginning, but not otherwise signed by the purchaser, is not a signing by such purchaser within the meaning of the statute. The writing of the name in that connection is merely for the purpose of identification, and not for authentication. Sutherland v.

     Validity of oral contract may be established by evidence other than memorandum.

    - The statute does not require that contracts within its purview be written. It merely interposes a bar to the enforcement of certain oral contracts, which bar may be removed by proof of a sufficient written memorandum of the transaction. When the bar is removed, it is the oral contract which is subject to enforcement, not the memorandum. Because the memorandum serves only to remove a bar to the enforcement of the oral contract, the validity of the oral contract may be established by other evidence. Drake v.

    - Where the memorandum of the bargain between the parties is contained in separate pieces of paper, and these papers contain the whole bargain, they form together such a memorandum as will satisfy the statute, provided the contents of the signed paper make such reference to the other written paper, or papers, as to enable the court to construe the whole of them together as constituting all the terms of the bargain. But if it be necessary to produce parol evidence in order to connect a signed paper with others unsigned by reason of the absence of any internal evidence in the contents of the signed paper to show a reference to or connection with the unsigned papers, then the several papers taken together do not constitute a memorandum in writing of the bargain so as to satisfy the statute. But it is not necessary that the signed paper should refer to the unsigned paper as such. It is sufficient to show that a particular unsigned paper, and nothing else, can be referred to, and parol evidence is admissible for that purpose. Darling v.

    - Notwithstanding the statute of frauds, equity will at all times lend its aid to defeat a fraud, yet to justify the court in relaxing the operation of the statute, and in compelling the specific execution of a parol contract for the sale of land, clear and convincing proof is essential, otherwise the desire to prevent fraud might result in great wrong and injustice to him who has the lawful right, and thus the prime object of the statute be defeated.

        <p>
         The principles upon which courts of equity have avoided the statute of frauds, upon the ground of part performance of a parol agreement, are now as well settled as any of the acknowledged doctrines of equity jurisprudence. From the numerous decisions on the subject, the following principles may be extracted and briefly stated as follows: (1) The parol agreement relied on must be certain and definite in its terms.

     Acts taking contract out of statute.
    </b>
    - Acts of part performance to take a parol contract out of the statute of frauds must be of such unequivocal nature as of themselves to be evidence of the existence of an agreement; as for example, where, under parol agreement to sell land, the purchaser is put in possession and makes improvements. Hale v. Hale, <cite class="va_code">90 Va. 728</cite>, 19 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 739</cite> (1894). See Pair v. Rook, <cite class="va_code">195 Va. 196</cite>, 77 S.E.2d 395 (1953).
        </p>
        <p>
         The delivery and taking possession of land by the purchaser under a parol contract, at the time of the purchase and in execution of it, where the purchase money has been paid, is such part performance as to take it out of the statute, especially where, if the sale were vacated, the purchaser would be unable to get his money back, and a pleading of the statute of frauds by the vendor would operate as a fraud on the purchaser. Long v. Hagerstown Agrl. Implement Mfg. Co., 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 665 (1878).
        </p>
        <p>
         An act of part performance sufficient to take a case out of the statute of frauds must be the definite and unequivocal act of the party relying thereon, or that of his predecessor in title or claim, strictly referable to the contract, with a design to perform it, and be such as but for the agreement would not have been done.

     Payment of consideration.

    - In general, the payment of the consideration is not such a part performance of a parol agreement for the purchase of lands as will relieve it from the operation of the statute of frauds. But where the consideration consists of services to be rendered, which are of such a peculiar character that it is impossible to estimate their value to the vendor by a pecuniary standard, the performance of the services will entitle the vendee to a specific performance, notwithstanding the contract was by parol.

         Where a principal, having no interest in the land to be purchased, makes a verbal contract with an agent to buy for him, and the latter purchases in his own name and with his own funds and then repudiates the agency and refuses to convey to the principal, the question whether the contract is within the statute of frauds and not enforceable against the agent, depends upon whether the contract in its essence and effect was one of agency or was one for the purchase of real estate. If it was the former, it creates a trust relation, is not within the statute of frauds, and can be established by parol; if the latter, the parties are to that extent dealing with each other as principals and the contract is within the statute and can only be established by such a writing as will meet the requirements thereof.

    - At law a defendant may insist upon the benefit of the statute of frauds by the general issue, or in equity, by simply denying in his answer that any such agreement was ever made as that charged in the bill. This general denial will put the plaintiff to the proof of the agreement, and, if it be within the statute of frauds, he must produce a writing at the trial or hearing, unless the defendant waives his right to require it by allowing the agreement to be proved by parol testimony.

         </b>
         - Oral contract presented nothing more than an acknowledgement of the parties' agency relationships with their respective real estate agents, and did not amount to a contract for the sale of land, since it wasn't in writing, and further, lacked the signatures of the contracting parties; where there was nothing ambiguous about the written instrument, parole evidence was not admissible to vary, alter or contradict its clear terms.

         After plaintiff made an unsolicited offer to buy property to the owners' agent, the agent spoke to one of the three owners, who he claimed told him the contract would be signed; however, one of the owners refused to sell. As there was no clear and convincing evidence that a parol contract was ever made, plaintiff's breach of contract and specific performance claims were barred by the statute of frauds. Belter v.

         - A memorandum, in order to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, must contain: (1) the name of each party to the contract, (2) a description of the land to be conveyed; and (3) the essential terms and conditions, but even where parties to an oral contract agree on the time of performance, courts typically take the view that time of performance is sufficiently minor or nonessential that its absence from the written memorandum is not fatal; thus, a deed was a written memorandum satisfying the Statute of Frauds where the deed executed by a stepfather contained all of the required elements and essential terms of the agreement because (1) the deed contained the names of all parties; (2) the deed contained a thorough description of the land to be conveyed; (3) the deed contained the consideration and price; and (4) although the deed contained no time for performance, the time for performance was no an essential term of the contract.

        <b>
     The law as to seals with respect to natural persons has been relaxed
    </b>
    by this section. Covington Virginian, Inc. v. Woods, <cite class="va_code">182 Va. 538</cite>, 29 S.E.2d 406 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule at common law has been changed by this section. Any writing to which a natural person making it shall affix a scroll by way of seal shall be of the same force as if actually sealed. Smith v. Plaster, <cite class="va_code">151 Va. 252</cite>, 144 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 417</cite> (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the foregoing decisions, the 1946 amendment of this section has made applicable to partnerships the provisions formerly applying only to natural persons.
       </p>
       <p>
        General Assembly has engaged the common-law seal requirement but has never abolished it altogether for deeds governed by the Statute of Conveyances. Game Place, L.L.C. v. Fredericksburg 35, LLC, <cite class="va_code">295 Va. 396</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 312, 2018 Va. LEXIS 54 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute does not abolish the seal requirement, but instead, it relaxes the seal requirement by offering a limited list of specific substitutes for a seal; the statute does not identify when a seal is necessary but instead only addresses ways to make a written instrument compliant with the seal requirement if either the common law or a statute require a seal. Game Place, L.L.C. v. Fredericksburg 35, LLC, <cite class="va_code">295 Va. 396</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 312, 2018 Va. LEXIS 54 (2018).

     There is no distinction between actual seals and scrolls,

    so far as constituting a writing a specialty, and either may be affixed to the signature. Bradley Salt Co. v. Norfolk Importing &amp; Exporting Co., <cite class="va_code">95 Va. 461</cite>, 28 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 567</cite> (1897).

        <b>
     Scrolls were in common use long before the statute
    </b>
    of 1788 (now found in this section) was enacted, and affixing a scroll to a writing for the purpose of making it a specialty was considered, as was said in Jones v. Logwood, 1 Va. (1 Wash.) 42 (1791), to be an act as solemn and as valid as making an impression upon wax for that purpose and as a good substitute for a seal. Bradley Salt Co. v. Norfolk Importing &amp; Exporting Co., <cite class="va_code">95 Va. 461</cite>, 28 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 567</cite> (1897).

         Valid scrolls.
        </b>
        - A paper which had the word "seal" affixed to the signature of the maker, and which met then existing common-law requirements, was held to be a sealed instrument within the meaning of the statute. Lewis v. Overby, 69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 627 (1877).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a printed form of bond was executed by the obligors signing their names to the printed stamps or scrolls thereon, which were recognized as their seals in the body of the bond, this was a sealed instrument within the statute. Buckner v. Mackay, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 488 (1831).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Proof of scroll used as seal.
        </b>
        - A typewritten copy of a deed showing the signature of the grantor, followed by parenthesis marks inclosing a blank space, is prima facie evidence that the original instrument had a scroll used by way of seal. Virginia & W. Va. Coal Co. v. Charles, 251 F. 83 (W.D. Va. 1917), aff'd, 254 F. 379 (4th Cir. 1918), appeal dismissed, 252 U.S. 569, 40 S. Ct. 345, 64 L. Ed. 720 (1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it is stated at the foot of an instrument that it was signed, sealed and acknowledged in the presence of two attesting witnesses, and the instrument is afterwards duly proved by the witnesses in court, it sufficiently appears that the person making the instrument affixed the scroll by way of seal. Parks v. Hewlett, 36 Va. (9 Leigh) 511 (1838).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Proof that scroll affixed without knowledge of maker.
    </b>
    - Parol evidence is admissible to show that, after an unsealed paper had been executed, delivered and recorded, a scroll by way of seal was affixed to the name of the maker, both on the original paper, and on the record, without the knowledge or consent of the maker. Burnette v. Young, <cite class="va_code">107 Va. 184</cite>, 57 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 641</cite> (1907).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Effect of extra seal.
    </b>
    - The validity of a trust deed is not affected by having on it an extra seal. Ward v. Churn, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 801 (1868); Miller v. Fletcher, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 403 (1876); Kyger v. Sipe, <cite class="va_code">89 Va. 507</cite>, 16 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 627</cite> (1892).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Compliance.
    </b>
    - By statute, the words "this deed" or "this indenture" must appear in the body of the instrument, not merely the title; the relative ease with which a party can comply with a statute is hardly a basis for excusing him or her when he or she does not even comply with the minimal requirements imposed on him or her, and if anything, the opposite is true. Game Place, L.L.C. v. Fredericksburg 35, LLC, <cite class="va_code">295 Va. 396</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 312, 2018 Va. LEXIS 54 (2018).

     Whether a paper declared on as a simple contract is sealed cannot be raised by demurrer,
    </b>
    but is a matter of fact to be presented at the hearing by proper plea or motion. It cannot be raised by craving oyer and demurring. Grubbs v. National Life Maturity Ins. Co., <cite class="va_code">94 Va. 589</cite>, 27 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 464</cite> (1897).

        <b>
     Corporate seal is prima facie proof of corporate act.
    </b>
    - The presence of corporate seal establishes, prima facie, that the instrument to which it is affixed is the act of the corporation, and dispenses with the necessity of any proof, on the part of the person claiming under it, that it was executed by the proper officers, that they had authority to so execute it, and that all proceedings, of whatever character, necessary to such authority, had been duly given, unless the corporation shall first by competent evidence on its part have rebutted the presumption arising from the presence of the common seal. Pascoe Steel Corp. v. Shannon, <cite class="va_code">224 Va. 530</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 97 (1982).

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     The word "Corp." typed above the printed word "(SEAL)"
    </b>
    is evidence of the intent of the parties to the instrument that it was to be evidence of a corporate debt. Pascoe Steel Corp. v. Shannon, <cite class="va_code">224 Va. 530</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 97 (1982).

        <b>
     Validity of unsealed note executed by corporation prior to 1970.
    </b>
    - A note executed in 1970 by a corporation, but without the corporation's seal affixed thereon was a valid obligation of the corporation, and the chancellor's reliance on Covington Virginian, Inc. v. Woods, <cite class="va_code">182 Va. 538</cite>, 29 S.E.2d 406 (1944), in erroneously holding that the note was invalid because the raised seal was not affixed was misplaced, since that case does not stand for the proposition that at the time this note was made all instruments executed by a corporation had to be sealed to be valid. White House Motel Corp. v. Bias, <cite class="va_code">219 Va. 19</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 241 (1978).

         Contract under seal imports a valuable consideration.

     Lease.

        <br/>
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Any person under the age of 18 or surviving spouse who has not remarried who is eligible for a guaranty of credit under the provisions of Title III of an Act of Congress of the United States approved June 22, 1944, entitled the "Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944," as now or hereafter amended, or other like federal law, shall be upon complying with the terms of this section, qualified to contract for and purchase any real or personal property with respect to which the guaranteed loan is to be made, to execute the note or other evidence of the loan indebtedness and to secure the debt by the execution of a deed of trust or chattel mortgage, or other instrument, upon the real or personal property acquired as aforesaid in connection with the proposed loan or theretofore acquired by such person, whether by purchase or otherwise, and such person shall, in all respects, be bound by such contracts or other instruments entered into as though he were of full age.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       When any such person is under the age of 18 years, no contract, note, deed of trust, mortgage, or other instrument required to obtain benefits under such federal legislation shall be executed by such person unless the circuit or corporation court of the city or county, or judge thereof in vacation, in which the property is located or to be used, after a petition signed by any such person has been filed with it or him, approves the same. Such petition shall set forth the facts pertaining to the proposed transaction and shall state why the judge or court should approve and authorize the execution of the necessary instruments.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The petition shall be heard by the court without a jury, and its decision thereon shall be final. A guardian ad litem shall be appointed who shall make an investigation and report in writing whether in his opinion the best interest of the petitioner would be served by permitting the petitioner to enter into such transaction, and the report shall be filed with the papers in the case. No such petition shall be approved by the court unless such approval is recommended by the report of the guardian ad litem and unless it is also recommended by the testimony of at least two disinterested and qualified witnesses appointed by the court, or the judge thereof in vacation. The order of approval shall recite the recommendation of the guardian ad litem and the witnesses and also their names and addresses. And the judge of the court hearing the case shall fix a reasonable fee for the attorneys and guardians ad litem.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The court, if of opinion that entry into such transaction would benefit the petitioner, shall approve the prayer of the petition, and the petitioner, if he enters into such transaction and executes any instrument required therein, shall be bound thereby as if of full age whether all or part of the obligation secured is so guaranteed.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       All rights that have accrued or obligations that have arisen under this section prior to January 30, 1947, are hereby declared valid and binding.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the court approves the prayer of the petition, such approval shall operate to vest title and confer the power to encumber or convey title to real or personal property acquired pursuant to such approval.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Any infant spouse of an infant veteran permitted by the court to make loans under this section may unite in any conveyance to effectuate such a loan as if he were a spouse of an adult signing as provided under the provisions of former § 55-42, relating to the removal of disability of infancy in certain cases.

     This section changed the rule as to the release of joint obligors.
    </b>
    - Formerly, the release of one joint obligor operated to release all. First &amp; Merchants Nat'l Bank v. Bank of Waverly, <cite class="va_code">170 Va. 496</cite>, 197 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 462</cite> (1938).

     But did not change the rule respecting joint wrongdoers.
    </b>
    - The fact that the General Assembly changed the general rule respecting the release of joint obligors, and left unimpaired the rule respecting joint wrongdoers, is persuasive that it was satisfied with and approved the law applicable to the release of joint wrongdoers. First &amp; Merchants Nat'l Bank v. Bank of Waverly, <cite class="va_code">170 Va. 496</cite>, 197 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 462</cite> (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action to recover for losses caused by defendant's failure to properly perform its duties as co-executor and cotrustee of an estate, it was held that plaintiff's release of the other acting co-executor and cotrustee operated as a release and discharge of defendant, even though the defendant's discharge was not intended. First &amp; Merchants Nat'l Bank v. Bank of Waverly, <cite class="va_code">170 Va. 496</cite>, 197 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 462</cite> (1938).

        Where tenants are obligated to pay a certain sum per month, during a certain period, under a sealed contract of lease, they can only be excused from its performance by showing that smaller amounts were expressly accepted by the owners in satisfaction and received in pursuance of an agreement for that purpose.

     Application of money by creditor held express acceptance.
    </b>
    - An agreement between a debtor and his creditor, fixing the amount of an unliquidated demand, constituted an accord, and the application by the creditor of one-half of the money received from the sale of a certificate of stock given him by the debtor for that purpose to the satisfaction in full of the indebtedness and his complete acquittance of the debtor from the obligation thereof, in pursuance of a prior agreement authorizing him so to do, while that agreement still existed, executed the accord; so that, at common law, the accord and satisfaction became complete. And even if the indebtedness was a liquidated demand, the application of the money was an express acceptance thereof by the creditor in full satisfaction of the debt, in pursuance of the prior agreement; so that, under this section, the same result followed.

          IV. EQUITABLE RELIEF.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         <b>
          Equity may relieve against gaming consideration.
         </b>
         - Where part of a bond is on gaming consideration, and the other part on lawful consideration, equity will relieve against the part which is vicious, and sustain that which is good; the obligor being plaintiff. Skipwith v. Strother, 24 Va. (3 Rand.) 214 (1825).
         <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          And against judgment on gaming debt.
         </b>
         - A court of equity has jurisdiction to relieve against a judgment founded on a gaming debt, although the party failed to defend himself at law, and gives no good reason for such failure. Skipwith v. Strother, 24 Va. (3 Rand.) 214 (1825), cited in White v. Washington, 46 Va. (5 Gratt.) 645 (1848).
        </p>
        <p>
         A judgment was obtained against the obligor in a bond given for a gaming consideration, and a writ of elegit was issued against his lands. A suit was brought by the assignee of the bond against the sheriff for an error committed in executing such writ, and a judgment obtained. It was held that a court of equity will relieve the obligor, and the sheriff also, on the ground of the turpitude of the original transaction. Woodson v. Barrett, 12 Va. (2 Hen. & M.) 80 (1808).
         <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Although no effort was made to obtain new trial in law court.
         </b>
         - Where defendant, in an action at law on a promise founded on a gaming consideration, was surprised at the trial, and there was a judgment against him, he may come into equity for relief, though he made no effort to obtain a new trial in the law court. White v. Washington, 46 Va. (5 Gratt.) 645 (1848).

       The General Assembly finds that investment in energy conservation measures and facility technology infrastructure upgrades and modernization in facilities owned by state and local government can reduce the amount of energy consumed, reduce long term operational costs and produce immediate and long-term savings. It is the policy of the Commonwealth to encourage public bodies to invest in energy conservation measures and facility technology infrastructure upgrades that reduce energy consumption, produce a cost savings, and improve the quality of indoor air in facilities, and when economically feasible, operate, maintain, or renovate facilities in such a manner so as to minimize energy consumption and reduce operational costs associated with facility technology infrastructure. Furthermore, state aid and other amounts appropriated for distribution to public bodies shall not be reduced as a result of energy and operational savings realized from a guaranteed savings contract or a lease purchase agreement for the purchase and installation of energy conservation and facility technology infrastructure upgrades and modernization.
