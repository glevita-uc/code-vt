      <p>
       The form of the compact shall be substantially as follows:
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       A compact entered into by and among the contracting states, signatures hereto, with the consent of the Congress of the United States of America, granted by an act entitled "an act granting the consent of Congress to any two or more states to enter into agreements or compacts for cooperative effort and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime and for other purposes."
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The contracting states solemnly agree:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol11">
        That it shall be competent for the duly constituted judicial and administrative authorities of a state party to this compact (herein called "sending state"), to permit any person convicted of an offense within such state and placed on probation or released on parole to reside in any other state party to this compact (herein called "receiving state"), while on probation or parole, if:
        <ol type="a">
         <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol11a">
          Such person is in fact a resident of or has his family residing within the receiving state and can obtain employment there;
         </li>
         <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol11b">
          Though not a resident of the receiving state and not having his family residing there, the receiving state consents to such person being sent there.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol12">
        That each receiving state will assume the duties of visitation of and supervision over probationers or parolees of any sending state and in the exercise of those duties will be governed by the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees.
       </li>
       <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol13">
        That duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any person on probation or parole. For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the person to be retaken. All legal requirements to obtain extradition of fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived on the part of states party hereto, as to such persons. The decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state; provided, however, that if at the time when a state seeks to retake a probationer or parolee there should be pending against him within the receiving state any criminal charge, or he should be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, he shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense.
       </li>
       <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol14">
        That the duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states parties to this compact, without interference.
       </li>
       <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol15">
        That the Governor of each state may designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other contracting states, if and when appointed, shall promulgate such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary to more effectively carry out the terms of this compact.
       </li>
       <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol16">
        That this compact shall become operative immediately upon its execution by any state as between it and any other state or states so executing. When executed it shall have the full force and effect of law within such state, the form of execution to be in accordance with the laws of the executing state.
       </li>
       <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol17">
        That this compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each executing state until renounced by it. The duties and obligations hereunder of a renouncing state shall continue as to parolees or probationers residing therein at the time of withdrawal until retaken or finally discharged by the sending state. Renunciation of this compact shall be by the same authority which executed it, by sending six months' notice in writing of its intention to withdraw from the compact to the other states party hereto.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Before granting such permission, opportunity shall be granted to the receiving state to investigate the home and prospective employment of such person.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       A resident of the receiving state, within the meaning of this compact, is one who has been an actual inhabitant of such state continuously for more than one year prior to his coming to the sending state and has not resided within the sending state more than six continuous months immediately preceding the commission of the offense for which he has been convicted.

        PURPOSE.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Compacting States to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the Bylaws and Rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each Compacting State in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The Compacting States also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. § 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the purpose of this Compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the Compacting States: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the Compact among the Compacting States. In addition, this Compact will: create an Interstate Commission, which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies and which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this Compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of State Councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Compacting States recognize that there is no "right" of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this Compact and the Bylaws and Rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the Compacting States that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

        THE COMPACT COMMISSION.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Compacting States hereby create the "Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision." The Interstate Commission shall be a body corporate and joint agency of the Compacting States. The Interstate Commission shall have all the responsibilities, powers and duties set forth herein, including the power to sue and be sued, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the Compacting States in accordance with the terms of this Compact.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Interstate Commission shall consist of Commissioners selected and appointed by resident members of a State Council for Interstate Adult Offender Supervision for each State. In addition to the Commissioners who are the voting representatives of each State, the Interstate Commission shall include individuals who are not Commissioners but who are members of interested organizations. Such noncommissioner members must include a member of the national organizations of governors, legislators, state chief justices, attorneys general and crime victims. All noncommissioner members of the Interstate Commission shall be ex officio (nonvoting) members. The Interstate Commission may provide in its Bylaws for such additional, ex officio, nonvoting members as it deems necessary.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        Each Compacting State represented at any meeting of the Interstate Commission is entitled to one vote. A majority of the Compacting States shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, unless a larger quorum is required by the Bylaws of the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission shall meet at least once each calendar year. The chairperson may call additional meetings and, upon the request of 27 or more Compacting States, shall call additional meetings. Public notice shall be given of all meetings, and meetings shall be open to the public.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Interstate Commission shall establish an Executive Committee, which shall include commission officers, members and others as shall be determined by the Bylaws. The Executive Committee shall have the power to act on behalf of the Interstate Commission during periods when the Interstate Commission is not in session, with the exception of rulemaking or amendment to the Compact or both. The Executive Committee oversees the day-to-day activities managed by the Executive Director and Interstate Commission staff; administers enforcement and compliance with the provisions of the Compact, its Bylaws and as directed by the Interstate Commission and performs other duties as directed by Commission or set forth in the Bylaws.

       <p>
        Each member state shall create a State Council for Interstate Adult Offender Supervision, which shall be responsible for the appointment of the Commissioner who shall serve on the Interstate Commission from that state. Each State Council shall appoint as its Commissioner the Compact Administrator from that state to serve on the Interstate Commission in such capacity under or pursuant to applicable law of the member state. While each member state may determine the membership of its own State Council, its membership must include at least one representative from the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of government, victims' groups and compact administrators. Each Compacting State retains the right to determine the qualifications of the Compact Administrator who shall be appointed by the State Council or by the Governor in consultation with the Legislature and the Judiciary. In addition to appointment of its Commissioner to the national Interstate Commission, each State Council shall exercise oversight and advocacy concerning its participation in Interstate Commission activities and other duties as may be determined by each member state including but not limited to, development of policy concerning operations and procedures of the Compact within that state.

        <br/>
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        If a majority of the legislatures of the Compacting States rejects a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Compacting State.

        Not later than 60 days after a Rule is promulgated, any interested person may file a petition in the United States District Court of the District of Columbia or in the Federal District Court where the Interstate Commission's principal office is located for judicial review of such Rule. If the court finds that the Interstate Commission's action is not supported by substantial evidence, as defined in the APA, in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the Rule unlawful and set it aside.

       </p>
       <p>
        Any State, as defined in Article II of this Compact, is eligible to become a Compacting State. The Compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the Compact into law by no less than 35 of the States. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2002, or upon enactment into law by the 35th State. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding, as to any other Compacting State, upon enactment of the Compact into law by that State. The governors of nonmember States or their designees will be invited to participate in Interstate Commission activities on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the Compact by all States and territories of the United States.
        <br/>

        Section A. Withdrawal.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every Compacting State; provided, that a Compacting State may withdraw from the Compact (hereinafter Withdrawing State) by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute that enacted the Compact into law.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Withdrawing State shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this Compact in the Withdrawing State. The Interstate Commission shall notify the other Compacting States of the Withdrawing State's intent to withdraw within 60 days of its receipt thereof.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Withdrawing State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        Reinstatement following withdrawal of any Compacting State shall occur upon the Withdrawing State reenacting the Compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.

       <p>
        Section B. Default.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        If the Interstate Commission determines that any Compacting State has at any time defaulted (hereinafter Defaulting State) in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the Bylaws or any duly promulgated Rules the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li id="t53.1c04a06s53.1-176.2-aXIIol11">

         Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;
        </li>
        <li id="t53.1c04a06s53.1-176.2-aXIIol13">
         Suspension and termination of membership in the Compact. Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the Bylaws and Rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the State Council.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a Compacting State to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this Compact, Interstate Commission Bylaws, or duly promulgated Rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the Defaulting State pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its default. If the Defaulting State fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the Defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of majority of the Compacting States and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension. Within 60 days of the effective date of termination of a Defaulting State, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer and the majority and minority leaders of the Defaulting State's legislature and the State Council of such termination.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Defaulting State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the Defaulting State unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the Defaulting State.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        Reinstatement following termination of any Compacting State requires both a reenactment of the Compact by the Defaulting State and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the Rules.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        Section C. Judicial Enforcement.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the Members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the Federal District where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provision of the Compact, its duly promulgated Rules and Bylaws, against any Compacting State in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees.
        <br/>

       <p>
        Section D. Dissolution of Compact.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the Compacting State that reduces membership in the Compact to one Compacting State. Upon the dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the Bylaws.

       <p>
        In the event any provision of this Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any Compacting State, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the Compacting State and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this Compact becomes effective.

       <p>
        The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trials of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.

         Constitutional and statutory provisions as to extradition.

        §

        Where defendant was notified of her rights pursuant to this section and provided the documentation necessary to trigger the benefits of the act, but did nothing to comply for nine months, after which time both Michigan and the Commonwealth fully complied with the required mandates, defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated. Miller v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 625, 513 S.E.2d 896 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred, as a matter of law, by holding that the accused's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial had been violated because the reason for the delay was legitimate; while at the time of his indictment accused was physically incarcerated in the city jail, he was legally in federal custody awaiting trial on multiple federal drug charges.

        - When the governor of an asylum state acts on an extradition request, he performs a judicial function. Accordingly, he would be entitled to absolute immunity in carrying out this function. Arebaugh v. Dalton, 600 F. Supp. 1345 (E.D. Va. 1985).

         Governor of asylum state to make factual findings and legal conclusions.
        </b>
        - While the Constitution mandates that a fugitive in one state "shall" be returned to the demanding state, the governor of the asylum state must make factual findings and legal conclusions following specific inquiries prior to granting extradition. First, he must determine whether the accused has been charged with a crime under the laws of the demanding state, and second, whether the accused was within the demanding state at the time of the offense. The former is generally a question of law but it may be a question of fact. The latter is generally a question of fact. The governor's factual determination may not be set aside unless it appears conclusively that the accused could not be a fugitive. Arebaugh v. Dalton, 600 F. Supp. 1345 (E.D. Va. 1985).

        Order for arrest served on defendant while in the county jail was not a detainer and the provisions of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers were not applicable to defendant because, although defendant did have an untried indictment in that county when he was served with the order while in federal custody, (1) there was nothing in the record to suggest that the order for arrest was ever filed with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, or any institution; and (2) there was nothing in the record to suggest that the state requested federal officials to hold defendant at the end of his federal sentence or notify it prior to defendant's release from federal custody.

         Jurisdiction.
        </b>
        - Jurisdiction is governed by statute and not geography and the IAD clearly provides that the United States of America is a separate "state." Although defendant was taken to the geographical location of Texas, he was never returned to the custody and jurisdiction of the State of Texas; he was taken to the 'state' of the United States of America and was in federal custody the entire time of his absence from the State of Missouri commencing when the Federal Marshals obtained his custody from the State of Missouri. As defendant was not returned to the sending state, the antishuttling provision contained in Article IV(5) was not violated. State v. Robertson, 182 S.W.3d 747, 2006 Mo. App. LEXIS 120 (Mo. Ct. App. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant contended that his drug and firearm convictions had to be reversed because the state violated article V of the IAD, by continuing to hold him after dismissal of a terroristic threat charge. The IAD neither grants nor divests a trial court of jurisdiction and, concomitantly, trial courts in this state do not depend upon the IAD for personal or subject matter jurisdiction, as both are independently provided by other statutes. To hold otherwise would have the unjustified and unwarranted effect of granting greater protection to a defendant over whom the state obtains custody pursuant to the IAD than to prisoners brought to Georgia by other methods. Accordingly, while the better practice in this case may have been for the state to follow a different course of action, e.g., to include all charges for which appellant was prosecuted within the detainer, return appellant to federal custody and file another detainer, or initiate other proceedings by which it could obtain custody of appellant, the state's actions did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction over the criminal charges filed against appellant.

         Procedure.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), required defendant's trial to commence by a certain date, when the state failed to bring him to trial by that date, his defense counsel properly filed a notice of expiration of the IAD's speedy trial period, but discharge pursuant to the IAD was not automatic, as discharge was appropriate only after certain procedures set out in Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.191 were followed including the "window of recapture," the 10 additional days for the state to bring defendant to trial. State v. Garza, 807 So. 2d 790, 2002 Fla. App. LEXIS 1940 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court held that the state failed to bring the prisoner to trial in a timely manner under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, where the process followed by the parties to accomplish the transfer mirrored the process set forth in article III, and the time limits of article III, rather than article IV, governed the transfer.

        - Absence of Interstate Agreement on Detainers Art III(d) documents from Massachusetts' prison officials in the files of the Hernando County clerk, and the failure to use standard IAD forms did not avoid application of the statute to dismiss Hernando County, Florida charges against the defendant.

       </p>
       <p>
        While trial court properly granted initial indeterminate continuance, defendant's right to be present during determination of actual length of continuance and to argue for trial date as close as possible to Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act's 180-day limitation was violated; accordingly, defendant's convictions were reversed.

         Speedy trial.
        </b>
        - Defendant's pro se motion for a speedy trial was insufficient to initiate the running of the 180-day period, because an inmate who wishes to benefit from Art. III's dismissal provisions must, at the very least, ensure that the receiving state has been given all of the information expressly listed in Art. III (a), including a certificate of inmate status. Commonwealth v. Copson, 444 Mass. 609, 830 N.E.2d 193 (2005). See also Commonwealth v. Malone, 65 Mass. App. Ct. 285, 838 N.E.2d 1265 (2005).

         Defense counsel agrees to delay.
        </b>
        - A criminal defense counsel's agreement to a trial date outside the time period set by the Interstate Agreement on Detainers bars the defendant from seeking dismissal on the ground that the trial did not occur within that period. New York v. Hill, 528 U.S. 110, 120 S. Ct. 659, 145 L. Ed. 2d 560 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any delay resulting from a request made to accommodate the defendant is properly excluded from the 120-day time limit calculation under the IAD. When defense counsel moved to withdraw from representation because of a conflict of interest, to allow the defendant to obtain different counsel who is not biased and does not have a stake in the outcome of the proceedings, under those circumstances, a motion to withdraw is clearly made in an effort to "accommodate the defendant" and the resulting delay was excluded from the time limit calculation.

        - The court held that where multiple jurisdictions within a receiving state have charges pending against a defendant, and one of the charging jurisdictions within the receiving state did not bring the appellant to trial within the time limit specified within the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), appellant should not receive the windfall of dismissal of charges merely because there are charges pending against him in so many separate counties that they cannot all be tried within the IAD time limits.

         Speedy trial waiver.

        - Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss the Illinois criminal charges against him based on his allegation that the IAD was violated when he was returned to federal custody in Indiana prior to a trial on the Illinois criminal charges; while it was true that the IAD had an anti-shuttling provision, that provision and the 180-day time limit of the IAD in general were waived when defendant filed a number of continuances, which had the effect of pushing the trial past the 180-day limit. People v. Davis, 356 Ill. App. 3d 940, 292 Ill. Dec. 989, 827 N.E.2d 518, 2005 Ill. App. LEXIS 380 (4 Dist. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The record demonstrates that defense counsel repeatedly and willingly accepted treatment inconsistent with Interstate Agreement on Detainers time limitations, thus the defendant is deemed to have waived such time limitations.

It does not address the issue whether those costs can then be passed on to a prisoner. We therefore do not read the IAD to conflict with, or impliedly repeal, a Colorado statute requiring prisoner to pay extradition expenses. People v. Fogarty, 126 P.3d 238, 2005 Colo.

         For equal protection purposes, inmates transferred

        pursuant to the Interstate Corrections Compact are "similarly situated" to those inmates in the receiving institution. Tucker v. Angelone, 954 F. Supp. 134 (E.D. Va.), aff'd sub nom. Tucker v. Virginia Dep't of Cors., 116 F.3d 473 (4th Cir. 1997).

         Receiving state as agent.
        </b>
        - Pursuant to the Interstate Corrections Compact, the "receiving state" acts "solely as agent for the sending state," which retains jurisdiction over a transferred inmate and may remove the inmate for any proper purpose. Taylor v. Washington, 2002 D.C. App. LEXIS 559, 808 A.2d 770 (2002).

         Jurisdiction.
        </b>
        - The court lacked jurisdiction to grant relief because under the Interstate Corrections Compact, Florida corrections officials act only as agents for the State of Kansas, and the Florida court lacks jurisdiction over the length of incarceration or whether that incarceration is served in Kansas or Florida. Meyer v. Moore, 2002 Fla. App. LEXIS 4198, 826 So. 2d 330 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2d Dist. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court lacked jurisdiction, absent any constitutional violations, to order the transfer of a prisoner under the Compact upon a prisoner's allegations that (1) he is fearful of other and (2) he wishes to be near his parents, because the legislature intended the Department of Corrections, and not the courts, to make decisions about which prisoners ought to be transferred under the Compact. State v. Tarver, 2005 NMCA 30, 137 N.M. 115, 108 P.3d 1 (Ct. App. 2005).

         Compacts.
        </b>
        - Petitioner challenges the circumstances of his transfer under the Interstate Corrections Compact and the authority of the Virgin Islands government to enter into compacts with sovereign states, such as Virginia, but while it is correct that Congress must grant such authority to the unincorporated territories of the United States, Congress already has acted in this capacity in 4 U.S.C.
