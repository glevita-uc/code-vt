     How indebtedness declared.
    </b>
    - Where the bill of particulars sets forth the items of account in sterling money, but its value is calculated and expressed in federal money, and the declaration alleges an indebtedness in money of account of the State, this is sufficient to admit the introduction of evidence of transactions between the parties in sterling money. The better practice, however, is to set forth in the declaration the indebtedness in sterling money, and leave it to the jury to ascertain its value in domestic money, or to state the indebtedness to be in foreign money of the value of so much domestic currency.

     Interest defined.
    </b>
    - The word "interest" imports a compensation taken for the loan or use of money, and in this sense it must always be taken and construed, except when it is made satisfactorily to appear that it was not used in its proper sense. Turner v. Turner, <cite class="va_code">80 Va. 379</cite> (1885). See also Mayo v. Judah, 19 Va. (5 Munf.) 495 (1817).

        <b>
     Why allowed.
    </b>
    - Interest is allowed because it is natural justice that he who has the use of another's money should pay interest for it. Jones v. Williams, 6 Va. (2 Call) 102 (1799). See also Washington &amp; Old Dominion Ry. v. Westinghouse Elec. &amp; Mfg. Co., <cite class="va_code">120 Va. 620</cite>, 89 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 131</cite> (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        This doctrine (of allowing interest for use of money) is founded in good conscience and correct morals. McVeigh's Ex'r v. Howard, <cite class="va_code">87 Va. 599</cite>, 13 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 31</cite> (1891).

     It may be by express contract.
    </b>
    - It has always been lawful in Virginia for parties to contract for the payment of interest for the use of forbearance of money within the limits prescribed by statute. Roberts' Adm'r v. Cocke, 69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 207 (1877); McVeigh's Ex'r v. Howard, <cite class="va_code">87 Va. 599</cite>, 13 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 31</cite> (1891).

     Or by contract implied.

    - When there is no express contract to pay interest there is an implied contract to do so. Chapman's Adm'rs v. Shepherd's Adm'r, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 377 (1874); McVeigh's Ex'r v. Howard, <cite class="va_code">87 Va. 599</cite>, 13 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 31</cite> (1891).

    - Generally, he who has the use of another's money must pay interest upon it from the time he receives it until he repays it, unless there is an agreement, express or implied, to the contrary. Hall v. Graham, <cite class="va_code">112 Va. 560</cite>, 72 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 105</cite> (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the settled rule that when no day is named in a bond or note given for the payment of a precedent debt, it is due and payable on the day of its date, and bears interest from that date. Kent's Adm'r v. Kent's Adm'r, 69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 840 (1877); McVeigh's Ex'r v. Howard, <cite class="va_code">87 Va. 599</cite>, 13 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 31</cite> (1891).

     It may be payable in installments.
    </b>
    - Where the time is 12 months or more, it is no violation of either the letter or the spirit of the statutes to contract that the legal rate due shall be payable in installments during the specified period. Blanchard v. Dominion Nat'l Bank, <cite class="va_code">130 Va. 633</cite>, 108 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 649</cite> (1921).

        - Where partial payments are made, so much of the payment as is equal to the interest is to be applied to the discharge thereof, and the residue toward discharging the principal, unless the debtor, at the time of the payment or before, directed otherwise. Lightfoot v. Price, 14 Va. (4 Hen. & M.) 431 (1809); Mercer's Adm'r v. Beale, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 189 (1833).

        - Where the parties agree upon a certain rate of interest and further provide that the rate is to be increased in case of nonpayment of the debt when due, the increase will be regarded as a penalty, and relief in equity may be had, although the increased rate is not more than the rate provided by statute. Waller v. Long, 20 Va. (6 Munf.) 71 (1818).

         Contract for compound interest is not usurious.

     But will not be implied.
    </b>
    - Where the principal of the debt is ascertained and there has been a continuing default in the payment of interest, although the contract provides for its payment upon recurring and for specified periods, a court in settling the account, in the absence of a specified agreement to pay lawful interest upon the installments thus in default, will only allow simple interest upon the principal sum due.

        - The taking of the discount in advance, upon discounting a note at a bank, is not usurious; and including the day of payment of the first note in the second, whereby the bank receives under each note interest for the same day, is not usury. State Bank v. Cowan, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 238 (1837), citing as its authority, Crump v. Trytitle, 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 251 (1834), and Stribling v. Bank of Valley, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 132 (1827).

    - The order of priorities among those entitled to rights in land and improvements put upon land as provided in the mechanic's lien statutes is a matter of public policy, one within the exclusive domain of the General Assembly.

    The legal rate of interest applies only in the absence of a lawful contract rate. Where the specified rate of interest is contracted for upon an obligation, and the rate is lawful, that rate will continue to apply after maturity of the obligation, and even after judgment, until the debt is fully paid. The reason for this is the court's lack of power to dispense with the obligations of lawful and valid private contracts. Fleming v.

     Determination of interest rate.

    - Because the amount of interest owed by a husband was dependent on the ultimate determination of the husband's child support arrearage, if any, and because the matter was remanded to the trial court for the recalculation of his child support arrearage, the court's interest award had to be reversed and remanded for reconsideration. Insofar as the husband's underlying argument as to the amount of child support owed remained pertinent on remand, the trial court did not err in applying the judgment rate of interest from the date each payment of support was due until paid in full or in determining the applicable judgment rate was 9 percent through a certain date and 6 percent thereafter.

       - From the adoption of the 1950 Code until March 1, 1968, the charging of a greater rate of interest on a contract "than allowed by law" was proscribed (the legal rate of interest being 6% at that time). The contract rate of interest was changed to 8% effective March 1, 1968, and to 12% effective July 1, 1987.

    - Usury is defined as being a premium or compensation paid or stipulated to be paid for the use of money borrowed or returned beyond the legal rate of interest established by law. Wherever, therefore, by the terms of a contract money is lent, and the lender is paid or stipulated to be paid a valuable consideration in excess of the rate allowed by law, the contract is usurious.

    - Any defendant may plead in general terms that the contract or assurance on which the action is brought was for a greater rate of interest than is allowed by law. Turner v. Turner, <cite class="va_code">80 Va. 379</cite> (1885).
       </p>
       <p>
        The policy of the legislature in adopting statutes of usury is the protection of borrowers against the oppressive exactions of lenders. It does not tend to the promotion of that policy that persons other than the victims of the usury should have the benefit of such statutes, and accordingly as a general rule usury is considered to be a ground of relief available only to the debtor or to one in legal privity with him. Stuart Court Realty Corp. v. Gillespie, <cite class="va_code">150 Va. 515</cite>, 143 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 741</cite> (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        A surety on a debt may plead usury, just as the principal may, where the sole consideration of the promise of the surety is the same as that of the principal debtor; that is, a loan or credit given to the principal debtor. Such is the position of an accommodation indorser. Ruckdeschall v. Seibel, <cite class="va_code">126 Va. 359</cite>, 101 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 425</cite> (1919).

       </p>
       <p>
        The plea of usury is a defense personal to the debtor, and the purchaser of land subject to a previous lien, which he assumes to pay as a part of the purchase money, cannot object that the lien is usurious, but is bound to discharge the lien, as part of the purchase price of the land. Spengler v. Snapp, 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 478 (1834); Saunders v. Baltimore Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <cite class="va_code">99 Va. 140</cite>, 37 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 775</cite> (1901).

     No plea is necessary where usury appears on face of written contract.
    </b>
    - The clause in this section that "if no such plea is made, and the contract or assurance be in writing and shows that usurious interest has been therein contracted for, judgment shall be rendered for the principal sum only," obligates the court to adjudge a contract usurious if it be in writing and the usury appears upon its face. Roanoke Mtg. Co. v. Henritze, <cite class="va_code">151 Va. 220</cite>, 144 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 430</cite> (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section specifically provides that where an instrument on its face reserves more than the legal rate of interest, it is usurious in its inception, and judgment shall be rendered for the principal sum only, although the defendant may have filed no plea of usury. Turner v. Turner, <cite class="va_code">80 Va. 379</cite> (1885).

        - Debtor's allegation that creditor's terms were usurious such that it was not entitled to any interest under Virginia law attacked loans creditor made to debtor as null and void, and bankruptcy court would make that determination in its consideration of validity of creditor's proof of claim pursuant to its constitutionally mandated duties; thus, it would conflict with Congress's vision of bankruptcy process to refer this allegation to arbitration.

         Necessary averments.
        </b>
        - A plea of usury should, on its face, either present such facts, with certainty to every intent, as in themselves distinctly amount to an agreement to receive more than the value of $6.00 for the loan of $100.00 for a year, or it must state the facts with such necessary averments of an intent to evade the statute that a jury, upon the trial, might decide that the agreement was in substance a contract for usurious interest, and a shift to evade the operation of the law. Steptoe's Adm'rs v. Harvey's Ex'rs, 34 Va. (7 Leigh) 501 (1836); State Bank v. Cowan, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 238 (1837); Smith v. Nicholas, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 330 (1837).

     Admissible evidence.
    </b>
    - All evidence relevant and material to show the real consideration for the contract is admissible, including evidence showing the facts and circumstances leading up to, connected with and attending the making of the contract, the acts done in pursuance thereof, and, where relevant, the agreements collateral thereto. Richeson v. Wood, <cite class="va_code">158 Va. 269</cite>, 163 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 339</cite> (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        The borrower may always prove by extrinsic evidence that the contract, though legal on its face, was in fact made for an usurious consideration. This is true, though the written contract may be a sealed instrument which on its face is complete, states a legal consideration, and shows no appearance of usury, and though such extrinsic evidence may vary, add to, or contradict the written instrument. Richeson v. Wood, <cite class="va_code">158 Va. 269</cite>, 163 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 339</cite> (1932).

     Answer as evidence.
    </b>
    - Where a crossbill exhibited as a bill of discovery charged usury, an answer under oath responsive to the crossbill containing statements, which, if true, disclosed a transaction free of usury, is evidence against the charge of usury which may be overcome by the testimony of two witnesses, or one witness and corroborative circumstances, and a different state of facts established. Ruckdeschall v. Seibel, <cite class="va_code">126 Va. 359</cite>, 101 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 425</cite> (1919).

       <p>
        <b>
     Usury as question of law or fact.
    </b>
    - Whether a contract is usurious or not is generally a question of fact for the jury. But where there is no material conflict in the evidence, and only one conclusion can reasonably be drawn from the facts proven, usury becomes a question of law for the court. Richeson v. Wood, <cite class="va_code">158 Va. 269</cite>, 163 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 339</cite> (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the facts are found by a special verdict, agreed upon by the parties or admitted by the pleadings or a demurrer, it is the province of the court to say whether they amount to usury or not. Brockenbrough's Ex'rs v. Spindle's Adm'rs, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 21 (1866); Brummel & Co. v. Enders, Sutton & Co., 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 873 (1868).

       <p>
        <b>
     Usurious contract is not void.
    </b>
    - No part of a usurious contract is void, but the contract is only deemed to be for an illegal consideration as to the excess beyond the principal so loaned or forborne. Fischer v. Lee, <cite class="va_code">98 Va. 159</cite>, 35 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 441</cite> (1900). See also Munford v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     And the lender may recover the principal.
    </b>
    - If a loan is usurious, the lender can only recover the principal sum lent, when it becomes due, and failure to pay interest notes according to their tenor does not constitute a default for which the lender may foreclose a deed of trust securing payment of the loan. Chakales v. Djiovanides, <cite class="va_code">161 Va. 48</cite>, 170 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 848</cite> (1933).

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     But a contract given as consideration for a usurious loan is void.
    </b>
    Where such a contract is supported by several considerations, only one of which is tainted with usury, but is not so severable that any part thereof can be assigned to the usurious consideration, and the other to the legal considerations, the whole contract is void. Richeson v. Wood, <cite class="va_code">158 Va. 269</cite>, 163 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 339</cite>, 82 A.L.R. 1189 (1932).

     Borrower may recover money paid under it.
    </b>
    - The rule that where a contract for an illegal consideration has been voluntarily performed, a party who has paid money under it cannot recover it back, has no applicability to usurious transactions. Richeson v. Wood, <cite class="va_code">158 Va. 269</cite>, 163 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 339</cite>, 82 A.L.R. 1189 (1932).

     Payment of illegal interest after maturity
    </b>
    of notes, in return for forbearance, is usury, and the usurious premium may be recovered back; but, the usury not being in the inception, the lender is entitled to his principal and legal interest, less the sum paid him at the dates of payment. Moseley v. Brown, <cite class="va_code">76 Va. 419</cite> (1882).

        <b>
     Usury is no defense against holder in due course of negotiable paper.
    </b>
    - The Virginia statutes do not declare usurious contracts void, but provide that, as to interest, they shall be deemed to be for an illegal consideration. Thus, a holder in due course can recover the full amount of a note, notwithstanding that at its inception the contract was tainted with usury. Moore v. Potomac Sav.

        <b>
     But plea casts burden of proof on plaintiff.
    </b>
    - The only effect of a plea of usury is to cast the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show that he is a holder in due course; when he has shown this he is entitled to recover. Lynchburg Nat'l Bank v. Scott Bros., <cite class="va_code">91 Va. 652</cite>, 22 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 487</cite> (1895).

       <p>
        <b>
     Where statute is amended.
    </b>
    - Though the statute of usury, at the time a contract was made, declared the contract to be null and void, if at the time of the decree in the action the statute has been amended and only avoids the contract for the interest, the decree should be for the principal lent, with interest from the date of the decree. Mosby v. St. Louis Mut. Ins. Co., 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 629 (1879); Bain &amp; Bros. v. Savage, <cite class="va_code">76 Va. 904</cite> (1882); White's Adm'x v.

     Amount of judgment.

King v. Buck, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 828 (1878); Munford v. McVeigh's Adm'r, <cite class="va_code">92 Va. 446</cite>, 23 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 857</cite> (1896); Exchange &amp; Deposit Bank v.

     Relief against judgment in equity.

    - A court of equity will interfere with a judgment at law to relieve against usury. This was held in Young v. Scott, 25 Va.

Fugate, <cite class="va_code">93 Va. 821</cite>, 23 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 884</cite> (1896); Jones v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">227 Va. 425</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 482 (1984).

     Extent of relief.
    </b>
    - In all cases involving the charge of usury, whether at law or in equity, no matter in what manner the question may be presented to the court, if the usury be established, the measure of relief will be that the lender can only recover the principal sum loaned or forborne. Greer v. Hale, <cite class="va_code">95 Va. 533</cite>, 28 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 873</cite> (1898). See also Ruckdeschall v.

     Application of payments made on usurious contract.

    - Where payments have been made on the usurious contract, which are merely credited on the bond, and not applied specially, the borrower is entitled to have such payments deducted from the principal sum loaned or forborne. They cannot be applied to the usurious interest although the debtor does not designate the application that is to be made. Turner v. Turner, <cite class="va_code">80 Va. 379</cite> (1885).

    - In interpretation of statutes on the subject of recovery back of usurious interest or the recovery of a penalty, the common-law rule of letting stand payments of principal and of legal interest actually made, and even payments by usury where the statute of limitation applicable to action of assumpsit has run, will not be held to be changed, except as to changes plainly made by the statute.

     Conflict of laws.
    </b>
    - A contract for the loan of money made in one state to be performed in another, is, as a general rule, governed by the law of the place of performance; and if the rate of interest allowed by the latter is higher than that of the place of contract, the parties may stipulate for the higher rate without incurring the penalties of usury.

       </p>
       <p>
        But if a contract made in this State is by agreement of the parties to be performed elsewhere, and the court is satisfied that the place of performance was selected as a mere shift to evade the usury laws of this State, the contract should be stripped of its disguise, and subjected to the penalties which the law denounces against the offense.

    - Where payments on an usurious obligation made by the maker and indorsers were not applied by them to the usurious portion of the debt or to any of the interest on such portion, and such application was not made by the payee, the court, where the usury is in issue before it, and is established, will eliminate the usurious principal and all interest, and will apply the payments on the principal sum justly due, and will allow the lender to recover only the balance of the principal thus found to be owing to him, without any interest.

        Any seller of goods or services who extends credit under a closed-end installment credit plan or arrangement may impose finance charges at such rate or rates as the seller and the purchaser have agreed. Deferrals and extensions of the time for payment, if allowed by a seller of goods or services who extends credit under a closed-end installment credit plan or his assignee, may be subject to a finance charge if agreed to in the original contract or at the time of the renewal or extension. No additional finance charge shall be made for the extension of credit under such a plan or arrangement. If the total finance charge on the transaction is precomputed according to the actuarial method, the finance charge shall be calculated on the assumption that all scheduled payments will be made when due. The balance on which such finance charge may be imposed may include the deferred portion of the sales price, costs and charges incidental to the transaction, including (i) any insurance premium financed in connection therewith and (ii) the amount actually paid or to be paid by the seller to discharge a security interest or lien on the property traded in. The payment by a lessor to discharge a security interest or lien on the property traded in may be included in the gross capitalized cost of the goods leased and, for purposes of this chapter and Chapter 6 (§ 55.1-600 et seq.) of Title 55.1, shall not constitute a loan.

On extensions of credit with an initial maturity of more than 61 months, the debtor shall receive a rebate computed under a method at least as favorable to the debtor as the actuarial method.

     Consideration of facts and circumstances.

    - In determining whether a transaction is usurious, the court has both the right and the duty to probe behind the written instruments and to examine all facts and circumstances which shed light on the true nature of the transaction.

     Proof of prima facie case.
    </b>
    - Usury, when pleaded, must be shown by clear and cogent proof, but the introduction in evidence of a contract expressly providing for a greater rate of interest than the law allows will establish a prima facie case. Thereupon, the burden shifts to the opposing party to go forward with evidence which would bring the transaction within an exception to the usury laws, or to show some other valid reason to avoid their application.

    - Where the "federal business taxes" referred to in the wife's handwritten note were in fact, and were known by the lender to be, family and personal obligations of the husband and wife, accordingly, neither the wife's handwritten statement nor the evidence of surrounding circumstances established that the loan was for any purpose other than family, household, or personal purposes.

      <p>
       "Applicant"
       means any person who applies to a creditor directly for an extension, renewal, or continuation of credit, or applies to a creditor indirectly by use of an existing credit plan for an amount exceeding the previously established credit limit.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Credit"
       means the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer payment of debt or to incur debt and defer its payment or to purchase property or services and defer payment therefor.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Creditor"
       means any person who regularly extends, renews, or continues credit; any person who regularly arranges for the extension, renewal, or continuation of credit; or any assignee of an original creditor who participates in the decision to extend, renew, or continue credit.

     Surety bond was not "credit" subject to statute.
    </b>
    - The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit holds that the issuance of surety bonds does not constitute a credit transaction as defined under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1976, 15 U.S.C.S.
    
     §
    
    1691 et seq., and the Virginia Equal Credit Opportunity Act,
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    59.1-21.19 et seq. [now see
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    6.2-500 et seq.], as the bonds do not involve a right to defer payment on a debt, and instead, the transaction involves insurance, rather than any debt or credit; thus, the owner of a contractor and his wife, who was required to sign an indemnity agreement in favor of a surety which issued surety bonds, could not invoke the protection of the equal credit opportunity statutes. Capitol Indem. Corp. v. Aulakh, 313 F.3d 200, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 25472 (4th Cir. 2002)(decided under prior law).

         Exception for special purpose credit programs.

        - The Virginia Housing Development Authority's credit assistance program clearly falls within this statute's exception for credit assistance programs authorized by state law for the benefit of economically disadvantaged homebuyers and, therefore, such program may consider an otherwise prohibited basis, such as marital status, to determine whether an applicant possesses a characteristic needed for eligibility.

        While this statute prohibits discrimination in credit transactions on the basis of several factors, including marital status, it exempts from this prohibition special purpose credit programs that are authorized by state or federal law and designed to help the economically disadvantaged.

     Debtor-creditor relationship between depositor and bank prerequisite to existence of "account."

    - Relationship between a financial institution and its depositor is that of debtor and creditor. The funds become the property of the bank immediately on deposit, and the bank becomes the debtor of the depositor. This relationship is prerequisite to the existence of any "contract of deposit" or "checking account . . . [or] other like arrangement" included within the definition of "account" in this section.

       Without qualifying any other statutory right to setoff or lien, and subject to any contractual provision, if a party to a multiple-party account is indebted to a financial institution, the financial institution has a right to setoff against the account in which the party has or had immediately before his death a present right of withdrawal.

     Confidential relationship existed with respect to transactions involving joint bank account.
    </b>
    - In a suit brought by an estate against the decedent's son for breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, and detinue, the trial court erred in holding that a confidential relationship did not exist with respect to self-dealing transactions by the son involving the joint bank account since the son was an agent of the decedent and, because he contributed none of the funds to the joint account, a confidential relationship existed establishing a fiduciary duty that created a presumption that the self-dealing transactions were unduly obtained. Flowing from that error, the trial court then erred in application of the evidentiary burdens regarding proof of undue influence and corroboration necessary under the dead man's statute,

     Undue influence.

    - Decedent's great grandchildren sufficiently alleged claims of breach of a "duty as an agent on a joint bank account" because the decedent's caretaker, her husband, and the decedent's sister were co-owners on accounts with the decedent for which the decedent provided all the funds, and as such, a confidential relationship existed between each of the three and decedent, and the burden fell upon the three to rebut the presumption that the challenged transactions were the result of undue influence.

        - Defendant exerted undue influence over the decedent, converted property of the decedent, and was liable to the decedent's estate for the amount required to restore the value of the decedent's property because defendant, who did not contribute to the joint accounts, was an agent as to the accounts; as an agent, defendant was a fiduciary of those accounts; he received considerable benefit from his self-dealing transactions; and he did not rebut the presumption of undue influence in those transactions; further, defendant's assertions that all funds he transferred from the decedent's accounts to his own account were used only for her benefit and that he paid himself nothing were not credible as the assertions were contradicted by the evidence.

       </h4>
       <p>
        <b>
     What "community" includes.
    </b>
    - "Community," as used in this section, embraces not just the immediate physical area, but the area whose population would be normally served by a bank if located at a particular site. Citizens Nat'l Bank v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">214 Va. 372</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 535 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a bank will customarily serve, to the greatest degree, the population in the immediate area which surrounds that bank, the term "community" is not so restricted or delineated. The word "community" embraces not just the immediate physical area but the area whose population would be normally served by a bank if located at a particular site. Covington Nat'l Bank v. State Bank, <cite class="va_code">219 Va. 566</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 163 (1978).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     A determination of the community or service area by the State Corporation Commission depends upon the facts in each case
    </b>
    - population density, topography, the proximity of other towns, the transportation system, trade patterns of the area, community of interest and numerous other factors. Citizens Nat'l Bank v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">214 Va. 372</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 535 (1973); Covington Nat'l Bank v. State Bank, <cite class="va_code">219 Va. 566</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 163 (1978).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     "Public interest" and former "public need" standards compared.
    </b>
    - The test which is to be applied in determining whether the "public interest will be served" by the banking facilities is not substantially different from the test required under the former provisions of this section prior to the 1976 amendment, which specified that the Commission was required to ascertain that there was a "public need for banking facilities or additional banking facilities." When the Commission determines that the public interest will be served by an additional banking facility, it is saying that there is a need for such a facility, and that, all things considered, the operation of a new bank, the increased competition it will generate, and the additional service and convenience it will provide the public outweigh any adverse effect the new bank might have on existing institutions and on the area involved. Covington Nat'l Bank v. State Bank, <cite class="va_code">219 Va. 566</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 163 (1978).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Public need need not be absolute or indispensable.
    </b>
    - The public need for an additional banking facility is not, and need not be, an absolute or indispensable public need. Second Nat'l Bank v. New Bank, <cite class="va_code">215 Va. 132</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 136 (1974).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Factors to be considered.
    </b>
    - Stimulation of the economy of the town, county and area which it intends to serve and stimulation of competition among the existing banks serving that market were proper factors to be considered by the Commission. Second Nat'l Bank v. New Bank, <cite class="va_code">215 Va. 132</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 136 (1974).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Presumption of correctness.
    </b>
    - Where the State Corporation Commission makes a determination to issue a certificate on the basis of conflicting evidence, this action carries a presumption of correctness and the Supreme Court cannot find the determination to be contrary to the evidence or without evidentiary support. Citizens Nat'l Bank v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">214 Va. 372</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 535 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        A presumption of correctness attaches to the Commission's action. Grundy Nat'l Bank v. Miner's &amp; Merchant's Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="va_code">214 Va. 732</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 277 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        A presumption of correctness attaches to the action of State Corporation Commission, in proceedings for certificate of authority to begin business as state-chartered bank. Covington Nat'l Bank v. State Bank, <cite class="va_code">219 Va. 566</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 163 (1978).

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Supreme Court not fact-finder.
    </b>
    - It is the State Corporation Commission, and not the Supreme Court, that is charged with the responsibility of finding the facts in proceedings for certificate of authority to begin business as state-chartered bank.

     Merger of state bank into national bank.
    </b>
    - The mergers of state banking and trust companies with national banks are not consolidations in any true sense. The state bank is absorbed and the national bank continues to function with powers limited and defined by Congress. When the merger is effected the state bank ceases to function. The new national bank is not the old state bank. It is merely a national bank with added powers and there is no continuity of corporate existence. The status of the old bank is exactly what it would be if it had been converted directly into a national bank, and so under

        A bank may establish and operate one or more branch offices, and a bank may relocate a main or branch office, provided the bank applies to the Commission for authority to establish or relocate any such office. Applications shall be made in writing on a form prescribed by the Commission and shall be accompanied by the fee established pursuant to § 6.2-908. As used in this section, "branch office" does not include any automated teller machine, cash-dispensing machine, or similar electronic or computer terminal, regardless of whether it (i) is located on bank premises or premises properly considered part of an authorized office of the bank or (ii) receives or records deposits, disburses loan proceeds, or provides for electronic fund transfers.

The review period may be extended for an additional 30 days. The Commission may deny such an application if the Commission finds that a proposal would have a detrimental effect on the applicant bank's safety and soundness or that it is otherwise not in the public interest. A branch office that has been denied shall not be established and a relocation that has been denied shall not be carried out. If the Commission does not issue a denial of a branch proposal or a proposed relocation within 30 days, or 60 days if the review period is extended, the proposed branch office or offices, or the proposed relocation, shall be authorized, and the branch or branches may be established and operated, or the relocation may be completed.

     Public interest standard.
    </b>
    - The crucial standard in the statutory formula for determining whether a branch bank should be authorized is public interest, and the public interest is considered served if advantages outweigh possible adverse effects such as diminished or unfair competition. Front Royal Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. First Va. Bank-Shenandoah Valley, <cite class="va_code">222 Va. 194</cite>, 278 S.E.2d 853 (1981).

     Soundness of savings and loan associations must be considered.
    </b>
    - The public interest formula for determining whether a branch bank should be authorized requires the State Corporation Commission to consider whether authorization may jeopardize the financial soundness of existing savings and loan associations as well as that of existing banks, because the public has a substantial interest in protecting all certificated financial institutions against ruinous competition. Front Royal Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. First Va. Bank-Shenandoah Valley, <cite class="va_code">222 Va. 194</cite>, 278 S.E.2d 853 (1981).

     Finding concerning jeopardy to existing institutions not required.
    </b>
    - The validity of an order granting the application for a banking office is not dependent on a specific finding concerning jeopardy to existing institutions. Services Nat'l Bank v. Burke &amp; Herbert Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="va_code">219 Va. 1031</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 77 (1979).

       <p>
        <b>
     Standards for small loan office less restrictive.
    </b>
    - Because the involvement of the public is not as great, the standard which applies in considering an application for a small loan office is less restrictive than the standard which applies when considering an application for the establishment of a bank or a savings and loan office. Peoples Fin. Serv. of Waynesboro, Inc. v. Beneficial Fin. Corp., <cite class="va_code">220 Va. 808</cite>, 263 S.E.2d 59 (1980).

     Establishment of branch bank not precluded by existence of adequate banking facilities.
    </b>
    - While the adequacy of existing bank facilities may be considered in determining whether public convenience and necessity [now public interest] will be served, this does not preclude the Commission from authorizing a proposed branch when there has been a showing of a public need and such authorization will not jeopardize the financial soundness of already existing banks and other financial institutions in a downtown area.

        The appraisals necessitated by this section shall be required if the loan shall equal or exceed an amount established from time to time by the Commissioner. In establishing such amount, the Commissioner shall take into consideration the requirements imposed on banks under applicable federal regulations. Such appraisals shall be in writing, signed by the appraisers, and shall be retained in the files of the bank, subject to examination of bank examiners. The appraisers so appointed shall be experienced persons competent to appraise real estate in the locality where the real estate is located.

     Purpose and intent.
    </b>
    - The meaning and intent of this section are clear. The section carries into effect a very definite public policy. It was highly desirable, of vital public interest and for the protection of the public that it be required of the officers of a bank, as a condition precedent to the negotiation of loans and the pledging of assets, that the board of directors first authorize the transaction by a resolution spread upon the minute books. The evil sought to be remedied was the borrowing and pledging of assets by the officers of a bank without the knowledge and assent of the directors. First Nat'l Bank v. Clements, <cite class="va_code">164 Va. 112</cite>, 178 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 791</cite> (1935).

     This section is reasonable.

    It protects banks against the unauthorized acts of its officers. First Nat'l Bank v. Clements, <cite class="va_code">164 Va. 112</cite>, 178 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 791</cite> (1935).

     However, its terms are general.
    </b>
    It neither carries a penalty for its violation nor any provision for its enforcement. It does not provide that the name of the lending bank be designated in the resolution of the board of directors; nor is it required that any definite amount to be borrowed be specified; nor is the amount of collateral to be pledged as security for the loan required to be specified. First Nat'l Bank v. Clements, <cite class="va_code">164 Va. 112</cite>, 178 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 791</cite> (1935).

     Resolution in general terms is sufficient.
    </b>
    - A resolution of the board of directors, in general terms, authorizing the officers of the bank to borrow money and pledge bank assets as security therefor, previously adopted and spread on the minute book, is all that is required by this section. First Nat'l Bank v. Clements, <cite class="va_code">164 Va. 112</cite>, 178 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 791</cite> (1935).

     And bank from which money borrowed need not be named.
    </b>
    - This section does not require the naming of the bank from which the money is to be borrowed to be set out in the resolution, but the fact that a bank has been named therein will not invalidate an otherwise valid resolution. The name of the bank may be treated as surplusage. First Nat'l Bank v. Clements, <cite class="va_code">164 Va. 112</cite>, 178 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 791</cite> (1935).

A controlled subsidiary corporation may charge and collect such finance charges and fees or interest rates as are authorized to banks by the laws of the Commonwealth or as otherwise authorized by Chapter 3 (§ 6.2-300 et seq.).

The provisions of § 6.2-876 relating to loans to officers, directors, or employees of the bank shall be applicable both to loans by the subsidiary to officers, directors, or employees of the bank and to loans by the bank to officers, directors, or employees of the subsidiary, with the approval of the board of directors of the bank only being required for purposes of § 6.2-876. The limitations of §§ 6.2-878 through 6.2-881 as they relate to appraisal value, maximum term, and amortization on loans secured by real estate shall be applicable to controlled subsidiary corporations.

The loan limit of the subsidiary shall be computed by attributing to the subsidiary a pro rata share of the lending limit of each bank stockholder prorated in accordance with the percentage of stock owned by such bank. However, in the case of a subsidiary, any of the stock, securities, or other obligations of which are owned by a bank holding company, the loan limits of the subsidiary shall be computed by attributing to the subsidiary a pro rata share of the lending limits of all bank subsidiaries of such holding company, which share shall be prorated based on the percentage of stock owned by the holding company and all subsidiary banks thereof. In computing whether a bank or a subsidiary that is not wholly owned is complying with its lending limit, the loans of the bank and the subsidiary to any common borrower shall be aggregated on a basis pro rata to the percentage of stock of the subsidiary owned by the bank. Such controlled subsidiary corporation shall not otherwise be subject to the provisions of this chapter except where it is expressly so provided. Notwithstanding any provisions of this subsection to the contrary, the restrictions set out in §§ 6.2-874 through 6.2-881 shall not be imposed upon any controlled subsidiary that has no state banks as shareholders.

The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged unlawful or unsound exercise of powers, or failure to exercise powers, or failure to comply, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held before the Commission to determine whether an order revoking authority to exercise such powers should issue against the association.

In the event of such consent or if, upon the record made at any such hearing, the Commission shall find that any allegation specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Commission shall issue and serve upon the association an order prohibiting it from accepting any new or additional trust accounts and revoking authority to exercise any and all powers granted by this chapter, except that such order shall permit the association to continue to service all previously accepted trust accounts pending their expeditious divestiture or termination.

        A revocation order shall become effective not later than the expiration of 30 days after service of such order upon the association and shall remain effective and enforceable, except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Commission or a reviewing court. In the case of a revocation order issued upon the consent of an association, such order shall become effective at the time specified therein.

     Factors to be considered.
    </b>
    - While the adequacy of existing bank facilities may be considered in determining whether public convenience and necessity [now public interest] will be served, this does not preclude the Commission from authorizing a proposed branch when there has been a showing of a public need and such authorization will not jeopardize the financial soundness of already existing banks and other financial institutions in the area. If such were not the case, the statute would tend to deter competition and promote monopoly. Mutual Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">212 Va. 557</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 13 (1972).

        Adequacy of existing banking facilities is only one of the criteria to be considered by the Commission in determining public convenience and necessity [now public interest]. Farmers &amp; Merchants Nat'l Bank v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">213 Va. 401</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 744 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding the adequacy of banking facilities generally, the Commission may still authorize the establishment of a branch banking unit if it finds that there is a need for a particular kind of service or for service in a particular location and that the financial soundness of existing institutions would not be jeopardized thereby.

The ownership or liquidation interest of any savings depositor of the subsidiary stock association in the net earnings and net worth of the resulting mutual holding company, and the voting rights of any such depositor in the mutual holding company, shall terminate, or otherwise be limited, in the same manner and on the happening of the same events as was the case prior thereto with the interest held by that depositor in the mutual association.

Such plan shall provide that holders of savings deposits in the reorganized mutual association shall be afforded an opportunity to preserve their interests by subscribing to the minority stock of the subsidiary stock association. The Commission shall approve any such plan of reorganization if the Commission ascertains that the reorganization shall not have an adverse effect on the stability of the association and that the reorganized mutual association has complied with all laws and regulations of the Commission relating to the reorganization of a mutual association into a mutual holding company.

For purposes of this percentage limitation, any issued and outstanding securities that are convertible into common stock shall be considered as issued and outstanding common stock. If at any time, the mutual holding company resulting from reorganization sells or otherwise disposes of outstanding shares in its stock association subsidiary, and as a result such mutual holding company no longer owns more than 51 percent of the outstanding shares of such association, or if the subsidiary stock association sells substantially all of its assets in a transaction in which substantially all deposit liabilities of such association are assumed and become liabilities of the purchaser of those assets, the Commission, on application of the Commissioner, may, after reasonable notice to the mutual holding company and its subsidiary stock association, appoint a receiver to wind up the affairs of the mutual holding company.

        A savings institution may make a real estate loan only after a qualified person designated by the savings institution has submitted a signed appraisal of the security property, except that an insured or guaranteed loan may be made on the basis of a valuation of the security property furnished to the savings institution by the insuring or guaranteeing agency.

        At the time of origination, a real estate loan may not exceed 100 percent of the appraised fair market value of the security property. During the term of the loan, the loan-to-value ratio may increase above the maximum permissible percentage if the increase results from an adjustment authorized by § 6.2-1182. In the case of a home loan secured by borrower-occupied property, the loan balance may not exceed 125 percent of the original appraised value of the property during the term of the loan, unless the loan contract provides that the payment shall be adjusted at least once every five years, beginning no later than the 10th year of the loan, to a level sufficient to amortize the loan at the then-existing interest rate and loan balance for the remaining term of the loan. The 125 percent limitation shall not apply to that portion of a loan balance that is interest received in the form of a percentage of the appreciation in value of the security property.

      <p>
       If the Commission determines that a credit union is violating any provisions of this chapter, it may, after a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing has been given to the credit union, direct that it discontinue the illegal methods or practices described in the order. If any credit union is insolvent, or has failed or refused to comply with the provisions of this chapter, the Commission may take possession of the business and property of the credit union and retain such possession until such time as it may permit such credit union to resume business, or until its affairs are finally liquidated under order of the Commission. Alternatively, the Commission may apply to any court in the Commonwealth having jurisdiction to appoint receivers for the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the business and assets and to wind up the affairs and business of any such credit union. The receiver when appointed shall become and be assignee of the assets of such credit union.

       When practicable and consistent with reasonable safety-and-soundness standards, the Commission shall encourage the formation of a separately chartered credit union instead of adding a new group to the field of membership of an existing credit union. If the Commission finds that the formation of a separate credit union by a group desiring such services is not practicable, or is not consistent with reasonable safety-and-soundness standards, it may authorize the group to be included in the field of membership of a state credit union that is located within reasonable proximity, if the Commission finds, based on the information it compiles, that the credit union proposed to be expanded:

         The contention is invalid that the State by means of the State Corporation Commission has become involved in securities regulations, an area legitimately subject to congressional supervision, and is therefore subject to suit on a theory of an implied waiver of immunity in a federal court on the same terms as any individual creating an injury in that area for which Congress intended to provide recovery.

         - While savings and loan enterprises undoubtedly peripherally and in some instances perhaps directly affect interstate commerce, the relationship is not one in which the immediate federal interests are exclusive, or where a federal act had preempted state interests. At the most, the state's activity is limited to a regulatory system paralleling and complementing the federal regulatory scheme. MacKethan v. Virginia, 370 F. Supp. 1 (E.D.

     Constitutionality.
    </b>
    - In dealing with the constitutionality of a small loan act, regard must be had to the consideration that any act designed to accomplish its purpose must be sufficiently definite and comprehensive in its selection of means and methods to frustrate the energy and ingenuity of the class at whom it is aimed, who so often regard the privilege of exploiting the necessities of borrowers as a vested property right.

     Liberal construction.
    </b>
    - The Consumer Finance Act is remedial in nature. Consequently, it must be liberally construed to avoid the mischief at which it is directed and to advance the remedy for which it was promulgated. Valley Acceptance Corp. v. Glasby, <cite class="va_code">230 Va. 422</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 291 (1985).

     Loan described as "mortgage loan" held subject to act.

    - Where the principal amount of a loan falls below the ceiling contained in the Consumer Finance Act, then, even if the lender is not licensed under the act, and even if the loan is described as a mortgage loan, that loan is nevertheless subject to the act.

         Applicability.
        </b>
        - Since plaintiff borrower alleged that defendant lender charged an interest rate well over 12 percent without the proper licensing, she was entitled to a recovery of $693.50 under the Virginia Consumer Finance Act. Tweedy v. RCAM Title Loans, LLC, 611 F. Supp. 2d 603, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38265 (W.D. Va. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action by borrowers against persons behind tribal lending entities that allegedly charged usurious interest rates, plaintiffs were entitled to enjoin defendants from violating Virginia's Consumer Finance Act only to the extent that the violations affect loans issued to them and the putative class because the statute provided for prospective relief only to the extent necessary to prevent the collection and receipt of any principal, interest and charges on a plaintiff's unlawful loan, and thus Ex parte Young-style relief was available only to the same extent, meaning the Court could not use Ex parte Young to enjoin future usurious lending by defendants. Hengle v. Asner,
    433 F. Supp. 3d 825, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3925 (E.D. Va. 2020).

     Loan described as "mortgage loan" held subject to act.
    </b>
    - Where the principal amount of a loan falls below the ceiling contained in the Consumer Finance Act [now Chapter 15 of Title 6.2], then, even if the lender is not licensed under the act, and even if the loan is described as a mortgage loan, that loan is nevertheless subject to the act. Valley Acceptance Corp. v. Glasby, <cite class="va_code">230 Va. 422</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 291 (1985).

     Mortgage loan subject to act if less than small loan ceiling.
    </b>
    - Where a loan falls below the small loan ceiling and is made by a person in the business of making loans below that ceiling, then even though the loan is in the form of a mortgage loan, it will be treated as a small loan and thus will be subject to the Consumer Finance Act [now Chapter 15 of Title 6.2]. Valley Acceptance Corp. v. Glasby, <cite class="va_code">230 Va. 422</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 291 (1985).

       <p>
        <b>
     Making of mortgage loans held evasive conduct.
    </b>
    - Where the making of mortgage loans was simply a device designed to transform a small loan into something other than a small loan and at the same time, it caused the borrowers to pay more for their loans than the Consumer Finance Act [now Chapter 15 of Title 6.2] would have allowed, this conduct was sufficient to establish an evasion as defined in this section. Valley Acceptance Corp. v. Glasby, <cite class="va_code">230 Va. 422</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 291 (1985).

         Licensure requirement.
        </b>
        - Requirement of licensure for non-commercial lenders doing business in Virginia is not a discriminatory restraint on trade, but rather a prudent exercise of the constitutional police power to regulate fraudulent activity; this general obligation to obtain a license to engage in the business of making personal noncommercial loans and thus be subject to the supervisory eye of the State Corporation Commission, is harmonized in subsection D of
        §
        59.1-199. Commonwealth v. NC Fin. Solutions of Utah, LLC, 100 Va. Cir. 232, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 602 (Fairfax County Oct. 28, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's actions in making a loan without utilizing a licensed business location in Virginia violated the Consumer Finance Act rendered the loan agreement void as the loan was initiated by an unlicensed location of defendant in Georgia sending a check offering a loan directly to plaintiff at her home address in Virginia; and defendant's initial unsolicited mailing of an offer for a loan with an interest rate in excess of 30% that included instructions on how to complete the loan (without the involvement of a licensed business location in Virginia) constituted the business of making a loan as contemplated by the Act, but any involvement by a properly licensed location in Virginia was for servicing the loan - not making the loan. Lendmark Fin. Servs. v. St. Clair, 102 Va. Cir. 502, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1788 (Page County Dec. 4, 2018).

        - No distinction is made between domestic or foreign-based lending entities, and no exception is provided for the loans made under choice-of-law provisions purporting to apply the substantive laws of another state to adjudicate disputes among contracting parties; if the General Assembly intended to exempt out-of-state noncommercial lenders from licensing, it would have so stated.

Specifically, the lender charged more than 12 percent interest without having a license, as required by statute, and without abiding by the statutory requirements of open-end credit lenders.

     Standard for small loan office not as restrictive.
    </b>
    - Because the involvement of the public is not as great, the standard which applies in considering an application for a small loan office is less restrictive than the standard which applies when considering an application for the establishment of a bank or a savings and loan office.

     Evidence of ruinous competition to existing licensees is a consideration

    which bears upon the convenience and advantage to the community and is a proper factor to be considered by the State Corporation Commission in determining whether to grant a license to establish a new small loan office.

         Virginia address required for license.

        - Defendant's actions in making a loan without utilizing a licensed business location in Virginia violated the Consumer Finance Act rendered the loan agreement void as the loan was initiated by an unlicensed location of defendant in Georgia sending a check offering a loan directly to plaintiff at her home address in Virginia; and defendant's initial unsolicited mailing of an offer for a loan with an interest rate in excess of 30% that included instructions on how to complete the loan (without the involvement of a licensed business location in Virginia) constituted the business of making a loan as contemplated by the Act, but any involvement by a properly licensed location in Virginia was for servicing the loan - not making the loan.

         Making of loans not permitted at place other than designated in license.

        - Defendant's actions in making a loan without utilizing a licensed business location in Virginia violated the Consumer Finance Act rendered the loan agreement void as the loan was initiated by an unlicensed location of defendant in Georgia sending a check offering a loan directly to plaintiff at her home address in Virginia; and defendant's initial unsolicited mailing of an offer for a loan with an interest rate in excess of 30% that included instructions on how to complete the loan (without the involvement of a licensed business location in Virginia) constituted the business of making a loan as contemplated by the Act, but any involvement by a properly licensed location in Virginia was for servicing the loan - not making the loan.

A licensee may charge and collect interest on a loan made under this chapter at a single annual rate not to exceed 36 percent. Interest shall not be charged on an add-on basis and shall not be compounded but shall be computed and paid only as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance. Interest shall be computed on the basis of the number of days elapsed; however, if part or all of the consideration for a loan contract is the unpaid principal balance of a prior loan, then the principal amount payable under the loan contract may include any unpaid interest on the prior loan that has accrued within 90 days before the making of the new loan contract.

The loan processing fee shall be stated in the loan contract. The loan processing fee shall not be deemed to constitute interest charged on the principal amount of the loan for purposes of determining whether the interest charged exceeds the 36 percent annual contract interest rate limitation imposed by subsection A. Upon payment of the full amount of principal due plus accrued interest and any other applicable fees within the first 30 days, whether through outside funds or a refinancing under a new loan advance, the borrower shall be entitled to a full rebate of the loan processing fee less an amount not to exceed $50 or the actual loan processing fee, whichever is less.

        - Defendant's actions in making a loan without utilizing a licensed business location in Virginia violated the Consumer Finance Act rendered the loan agreement void as the loan was initiated by an unlicensed location of defendant in Georgia sending a check offering a loan directly to plaintiff at her home address in Virginia; and defendant's initial unsolicited mailing of an offer for a loan with an interest rate in excess of 30% that included instructions on how to complete the loan (without the involvement of a licensed business location in Virginia) constituted the business of making a loan as contemplated by the Act, but any involvement by a properly licensed location in Virginia was for servicing the loan - not making the loan.

       Upon the filing and investigation of an application for a license and compliance by the applicant with all applicable provisions of this chapter, the Commission shall issue and deliver to the applicant the license applied for to engage in business under this chapter if it finds that the financial responsibility, character, and general fitness of the applicant are such as to warrant belief that the licensee will act as a mortgage loan originator efficiently and fairly, in the public interest, and in accordance with law. If the Commission fails to make such findings, no license shall be issued and the Commissioner shall notify the applicant of the denial and the reasons for such denial. The Commission shall not base a license denial, in whole or in part, on an applicant's credit score, nor shall it use a credit report as the sole basis for license denial.

During any period that the database is unavailable due to technical problems beyond the licensee's control, a licensee may rely on the loan applicant's written representations, rather than the database's information, to verify that making the loan applied for is permissible under the provisions of this chapter.

If the database advises the licensee that the applicant is ineligible for a short-term loan, then the applicant shall direct any inquiry regarding the specific reason for such ineligibility to the database provider rather than to the licensee. The information contained in the database is confidential and exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (§ 2.2-3700 et seq.).

If a licensee submits a database inquiry but does not consummate a loan with the applicant, then the licensee shall not pay the database inquiry fee.
