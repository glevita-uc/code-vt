        Editor's note.
       </b>
       - At its 1954 session the General Assembly directed the Virginia Code Commission to revise the laws of Virginia relating to corporations generally, and particularly Title 13 relating to business corporations, and in September, 1955, the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing the proposed revision. The report, which is entitled "Report by the Code Commission of Virginia for Revision of the Laws Relating to Corporations," was published as House Document 5 of the 1956 session, and contains revisor's notes and comments which, while valuable, are too voluminous for inclusion here. The Code Commission's draft of the revision, as amended by the General Assembly, became Chapter 428 of the Acts of 1956, which repealed Title 13 and enacted in lieu thereof Title 13.1 of the Code.

       Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former law.

       An association may amend its articles of incorporation by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members voting thereon at any regular meeting, or at a special meeting called for the purpose.

No amendment affecting the priority or preferential rights of any outstanding nonvoting stock shall be adopted until the written consent of two-thirds of the holders of such outstanding nonvoting stock has been obtained. Triplicate originals of the articles of amendment duly signed and acknowledged together with the filing fee required to be paid shall be delivered to the Commission. If the Commission finds that the articles comply with the requirements of law and that all required fees have been paid, it shall by order issue a certificate of amendment, which shall be admitted to record in its office. Upon the issuance of such certificate, it shall become effective in accordance with its terms.

     Constitutionality.
    </b>
    - The Virginia Securities Act (VSA) expressly identifies notes as being included within the definition of securities. Furthermore, the VSA's treatment of promissory notes as securities is not novel or atypical of the treatment afforded notes by the federal or other states' securities acts. Therefore, appellant's claim that the act was unconstitutionally vague was without merit. Welsh v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 300, 416 S.E.2d 451 (1992), aff'd, <cite class="va_code">246 Va. 337</cite>, 437 S.E.2d 914 (1993).

     Known as Blue Sky Law.
    </b>
    - The term Blue Sky Law is a popular name for acts providing for the regulation and supervision of investment companies, for the protection of the community from investing in fraudulent companies; a law intended to stop the sale of stock in fly-by-night concerns and other like fraudulent exploitations. Virginia Brewing Co. v. Webber, <cite class="va_code">167 Va. 67</cite>, 187 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 447</cite> (1936).

     Purpose is to prevent unfairness.
    </b>
    - The purpose of laws regulating the promotion and sale of securities is to protect the public against the imposition of fraudulent or unsubstantial schemes or projects, or from being misled into the purchase of securities based upon them. Travelers Health Ass'n v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">188 Va. 877</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 263 (1949), aff'd, 339 U.S. 643, 70 S. Ct. 927, 94 L. Ed. 1154 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        The object and purpose of the act is to prevent unfairness, imposition or fraud in the sale of certain securities therein mentioned, by inspecting and regulating the business of those engaged or intending to engage in the sale or disposition of such securities and by prescribing penalties for the violation thereof. Watters &amp; Martin, Inc. v. Homes Corp., <cite class="va_code">136 Va. 114</cite>, 116 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 366</cite> (1923).

     Construction.
    </b>
    - The federal courts have construed broadly the disclosure and regulation requirements of the federal acts. As a corollary, they read narrowly the exemption provisions. Virginia's act should receive similar construction. Pollok v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">217 Va. 411</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 858 (1976).

    78c, known as the 1934 Act, defined "security" to include, unless the context required otherwise, any "stock," the stock involved in the transaction was a security regulated by the Virginia Securities Act since the stock had the traditional indicia of stock, such as dividends, negotiability, and voting rights.

     Protection of investors through disclosure.
    </b>
    - Like the federal Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C.
    
     §
    
    77a et seq. (1970)) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C.
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    78a et seq. (1970)), Virginia's Securities Act is intended to protect investors from fraudulent sales of securities. Both the Virginia act and the federal acts achieve their ends in similar ways: the disclosure of material information concerning issuers of stock and the regulation of sellers of securities. Pollok v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">217 Va. 411</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 858 (1976).

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     "Person" and "security holder" different.
    </b>
    - An examination of the act reveals that the term "person" is employed in those sections which either prohibit certain activities or require registration with the Commission. On the other hand, the term "security holder" is employed in the exemption section. Unquestionably, the General Assembly intended the two terms to have different meanings and designed them to serve varying purposes. Pollok v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">217 Va. 411</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 858 (1976).
    <br/>

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Promissory note is presumed to be a security.
        </b>
        - Under the Virginia Securities Act, a promissory note is presumed to be a security. Ascher v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 1105, 408 S.E.2d 906 (1991), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 865, 113 S. Ct. 190, 121 L. Ed. 2d 134 (1992).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The presumption that a note is a security may be overcome
        </b>
        by showing that the instrument does not have the characteristics or qualities of a security. Ascher v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 1105, 408 S.E.2d 906 (1991), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 865, 113 S. Ct. 190, 121 L. Ed. 2d 134 (1992).

        <b>
         Characteristics of nonsecurities.
        </b>
        - If a promissory note does not resemble any of those commonly recognized commercial instruments which are not considered securities, the court must consider and decide whether the note may fall within a broader definition of a promissory note that is not a security. Ascher v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 1105, 408 S.E.2d 906 (1991), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 865, 113 S. Ct. 190, 121 L. Ed. 2d 134 (1992).

         The first factor
        </b>
        is the motivations which would influence the buyer's and seller's decision in entering into the transaction. If the seller is raising operational funds for an enterprise and the buyer is interested in profit, the instrument is most likely to be a security. Ascher v. Commonwealth, 12 Va.

         The second factor
        </b>
        is the plan of distribution set up for the notes. Offering notes to a broad segment of the public is all that is necessary to establish the requisite common trading to qualify the note as a security. Ascher v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 1105, 408 S.E.2d 906 (1991), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 865, 113 S. Ct. 190, 121 L. Ed. 2d 134 (1992).

         Statute of limitations.
        </b>
        - Federal policy is best served by applying the state blue sky law's two-year statute of limitations to a suit involving the fraudulent sale of securities. Newman v. Prior, 518 F.2d 97 (4th Cir. 1975), overruled on other grounds, Newcome v. Esrey, 862 F.2d 1099 (4th Cir. 1988).

        Even when state law furnishes the period of limitation, federal law controls its commencement.

Prior, 518 F.2d 97 (4th Cir. 1975), overruled on other grounds, Newcome v. Esrey, 862 F.2d 1099 (4th Cir. 1988).

         Constitutionality of registration requirement.
        </b>
        - The simple requirement that brokers register with the State Corporation Commission pursuant to the Virginia Securities Act in order to do business with Virginia residents does not in any way offend the due process clause, the commerce clause, the supremacy clause, or the First Amendment. Underhill Assocs. v. Coleman, 504 F. Supp. 1147 (E.D. Va. 1981), aff'd, 674 F.2d 293 (4th Cir. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        As this section applies evenly to both local and foreign broker-dealers and the only burden it places on interstate commerce is the requirement that all broker-dealers register and pay an annual fee, it does not violate Art. I,
        §
        8, clause 3, of the United States Constitution. Underhill Assocs. v. Bradshaw, 674 F.2d 293 (4th Cir. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The registration provisions of this section have not been preempted by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.
        §
        78a et seq., and are thus not violative of Article 6, clause 2, of the United States Constitution. Underhill Assocs. v. Bradshaw, 674 F.2d 293 (4th Cir. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The registration provisions of this section neither regulate commercial speech nor prohibit the out-of-state discount securities brokers from advertising and thus this section does not violate First Amendment rights to advertise. Underhill Assocs. v. Bradshaw, 674 F.2d 293 (4th Cir. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Virginia does not violate the due process clause by requiring out-of-state discount securities brokers to register with the State Corporation Commission, as it is in the Commonwealth's interest to protect its citizens from possibly dishonest or incompetent securities dealers. Underhill Assocs. v. Bradshaw, 674 F.2d 293 (4th Cir. 1982).

         Constitutionality of administratively imposed in-state office requirement.
        </b>
        - In an action instituted by three discount securities brokerage firms challenging the constitutionality of the registration requirements of the Virginia Securities Act, administratively imposed in-state office requirement was held to be unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs since its obvious effect was prejudicial to out-of-state brokers, who had to duplicate the expense of maintaining an office in Virginia in order to do business with its residents; thus, the State Corporation Commission could not, consistent with the commerce clause, deny plaintiffs or similarly situated brokers' applications for registration solely on the grounds that the applicant did not have a regular place of business in Virginia. Underhill Assocs. v. Coleman, 504 F. Supp. 1147 (E.D. Va. 1981), aff'd, 674 F.2d 293 (4th Cir. 1982).

        - In an action instituted by three discount securities brokerage firms challenging the constitutionality of the registration requirements of the Virginia Securities Act, administratively imposed in-state office requirement was held to be unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs since its obvious effect was prejudicial to out-of-state brokers, who had to duplicate the expense of maintaining an office in Virginia in order to do business with its residents; thus, the State Corporation Commission could not, consistent with the commerce clause, deny plaintiffs or similarly situated brokers' applications for registration solely on the grounds that the applicant did not have a regular place of business in Virginia.

       (h)
    If any prospectus, document or exhibit filed as provided in this section discloses that any of the securities sought to be registered by qualification, or as much as twenty-five percent of any class of the securities of the issuer to be outstanding, were or are intended to be issued for any patent right, copyright, trademark, process, formula, goodwill or other intangible assets, or for organization or promotion fees or expenses, the Commission may require that such securities shall be delivered in escrow to some satisfactory depository under an escrow agreement. The owners of such securities shall not be entitled to sell or transfer such securities or to withdraw such securities from escrow until the issuer in any period of thirty-six consecutive months earns an annual average of six percent of the public offering price times all shares of common stock then outstanding plus those to be outstanding through the exercise of warrants or options as computed under normal and customary accounting procedures or upon order of the Commission, when no circumstance is apparent which, in the opinion of the Commission, would warrant continuation of the escrow.
    In case of dissolution or insolvency during the time such securities are held in escrow, the owners of such securities shall not participate in the assets until after the owners of all other securities shall have been paid in full. If any securities sought to be registered by qualification are to be sold for the account of the issuer, and not by underwriters who have or at the time of offering shall have purchased such securities from the issuer, the Commission may require that the proceeds from the sale of such securities be delivered in escrow to some satisfactory depository until all or a reasonable portion of the total securities originally proposed to be offered and sold shall have been sold and paid for.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       For the purposes of this section, such securities shall be deemed to have been sold and paid for at such time as the subscribers therefor deliver to, or for the benefit of, the issuer, an amount equal to the purchase price specified for such securities either in cash, a draft, check or note (other than any such instrument which is drawn without recourse) or any combination thereof.

      </h3>
      <p>
       A registration statement filed under this article may be filed by the issuer, any other person on whose behalf the offer is to be made or by any registered broker-dealer. When securities are registered, they may be offered and sold by the issuer, by such other person or by any registered broker-dealer, whether or not named in the registration statement. Every registration statement shall remain effective until revoked by the Commission or until terminated upon request of the registrant with the consent of the Commission. So long as a registration statement remains effective, all outstanding securities of the same class shall be considered to be registered for the purpose of any nonissuer distribution. So long as the registration statement remains effective, the Commission may require the registrant to file reports, not more often than quarterly, to keep reasonably current the information contained in the registration statement. The Commission may require such information to be included in the prospectus.

     Construction.
    </b>
    - The federal courts have construed broadly the disclosure and regulation requirements of the federal acts. As a corollary, they read narrowly the exemption provisions. Virginia's act should receive similar construction. Pollok v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">217 Va. 411</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 858 (1976).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     "Person" and "security holder" different.
    </b>
    - An examination of the act reveals that the term "person" is employed in those sections which either prohibit certain activities or require registration with the Commission. On the other hand, the term "security holder" is employed in the exemption section. Unquestionably, the General Assembly intended the two terms to have different meanings and designed them to serve varying purposes. Pollok v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">217 Va. 411</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 858 (1976).

         Burden on seller prior to transaction to determine purchaser's status.
        </b>
        - Although purchaser represented that he was in the real estate investment business and had a number of companies with overlapping boards of directors, the burden remained on seller to ascertain, prior to entering into the challenged transaction, that the purchaser was operating as a corporation or investment company as those terms are used in the Virginia Securities Act's provisions exempting the business from this Act. Shavin v. Commonwealth, 17 Va. App. 256, 437 S.E.2d 411 (1993).

        <b>
         The purpose of the Virginia Securities Act,
        </b>
        known as the "Blue Sky Law," is primarily to suppress the sale of stocks of little or no value. Stevens v. Abbott, Proctor & Paine, 288 F. Supp. 836 (E.D. Va. 1968).

        <b>
         Legislative intent.
        </b>
        - The General Assembly intended for a buyer of securities to recover damages for any sale of securities in violation of the statute, regardless of whether the buyer happened to profit from other sales of securities in violation of the statute. Merchant v. Oppenheimer & Co., 568 F. Supp. 639 (E.D. Va. 1983), rev'd on other grounds, 739 F.2d 165 (4th Cir. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no apparent reason to suppose that in employing the terms "offer" and "accept," the Virginia General Assembly intended to incorporate into the statute several centuries of technical common-law rules of contract formation. Merchant v. Oppenheimer & Co., 568 F. Supp. 639 (E.D. Va. 1983), rev'd on other grounds, 739 F.2d 165 (4th Cir. 1984).

         Statute is intended to govern those who sell securities within the state even though incorporated elsewhere

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Virginia has a legitimate interest in applying its securities laws to operations conducted within the state,
        </b>
        even if aimed at nonresidents. And if the General Assembly chooses to regulate these transactions through the imposition of statutory civil liability in addition to criminal liability, it is free to do so. Lintz v. Carey Manor Ltd., 613 F. Supp. 543 (W.D. Va. 1985).

         Jurisdiction.
        </b>
        - Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered blue sky liability by proving that a government-sponsored entity incurred irrevocable liability to purchase loan backing private-label securitizations (PLS) in the Commonwealth where nothing required the FHFA to present testimony from someone who had direct knowledge about how and where the entity's PLS traders executed the trades at issue, and two entity employees stated that the entity's PLS traders purchased PLS certificates generally from an office in Virginia. Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Nomura Holding Am., Inc., 873 F.3d 85, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 18803 (2nd Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 2679, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 3924 (2018).

         Act does not require scienter.
        </b>
        - Unlike its federal counterpart, the Virginia Securities Act does not require scienter; a plaintiff need not establish that the fraudulent representation was made knowingly or with reckless indifference to its truth or falsity; the mere fact of the issuance of the statement is enough. Diaz Vicente v. Obenauer, 736 F. Supp. 679 (E.D. Va. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion by a company and its chief executive officer to dismiss an investor's securities fraud action was denied because the investor adequately pled false misrepresentations, and loss causation and scienter were not required elements to state a claim under the Virginia Securities Act. Carlucci v. Han,, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153676 (E.D. Va. Oct. 24, 2012).

         Subsection D is designed to allow parties to avoid litigation and quickly settle their differences.
        </b>
        The needs of such parties are different from the needs of parties negotiating a commercial transaction. In light of such considerations, the General Assembly more likely intended a common-sense inquiry into the parties' intent to determine whether a statutory contract has been formed. Merchant v. Oppenheimer & Co., 568 F. Supp. 639 (E.D. Va. 1983), rev'd on other grounds, 739 F.2d 165 (4th Cir. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The language of subsection D of this section reflects the fact that, under subsection A of this section, liability may be based on the sale of a single security in violation of the statute; subsection D then allows the seller to make an offer concerning "the security." Merchant v. Oppenheimer & Co., 568 F. Supp. 639 (E.D. Va. 1983), rev'd on other grounds, 739 F.2d 165 (4th Cir. 1984).

         No discovery provision implied by language of subsection D.

        <span class="s1">
         §

        13.1-502, it is not surprising that the General Assembly should decide that the accrual of the cause of action should take place at the time of the underlying transaction. Cors v. Langham, 683 F. Supp. 1056 (E.D. Va. 1988).

         Atmosphere in which statements are made may bear on their materiality,
        </b>
        however, where conversation took place on a golf course between casual acquaintances and concerned a bank about which buyer had no prior knowledge, the context in which the statements were made undermined buyer's theory of materiality. Howard v. Haddad, 962 F.2d 328 (4th Cir. 1992).

         "Materiality" absent

        where seller told buyer that he was a director of bank for which the stock was offered, that the bank was growing, that the stock was a good investment, that the stock was a good opportunity, and that he would have difficulty securing stock for the buyer to purchase; such statements at most amounted to puffery and lacked the materiality essential to a securities fraud allegation. Howard v. Haddad, 962 F.2d 328 (4th Cir. 1992).

       <p>
        <b>
         Damages recoverable on any sale regardless of profit on others.
        </b>
        - The clear language of the act, when considered with its purpose of protecting purchasers, supports the holding that the buyer of securities may recover damages for any sale of securities in violation of the statute, regardless of whether the buyer happened to profit from other sales of securities in violation of the statute. Dixon v. Oppenheimer & Co., 739 F.2d 165 (4th Cir. 1984).

        <b>
         Seller may not repurchase securities which purchaser does not wish to sell.
        </b>
        - There is nothing in the language of the act to support the seller's claim of a right to repurchase securities which the purchaser does not wish to sell or to require the purchaser to reduce his losses by his gains. Dixon v. Oppenheimer & Co., 739 F.2d 165 (4th Cir. 1984).
        <br/>

       <p>
        <b>
         Transactions may not be aggregated over objection of purchaser.
        </b>
        - This section refers to "a security sold in violation" and not to "all securities sold in violation." This would support an interpretation that each transaction is separate and they may not be aggregated over a purchaser's objection. Dixon v. Oppenheimer & Co., 739 F.2d 165 (4th Cir. 1984).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The interest due under this section should be computed from the date of purchase of each security.

         Limitation to be applied to federal securities actions.
        </b>
        - Since there is no general federal statute of limitations and no statute of limitations provision in either section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933 or section 10 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, when the federal legislative act is silent as to the statute of limitations applicable to it, the limitations period of the forum state is applicable. Maine v. Leonard, 353 F. Supp. 968 (W.D. Va. 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Federal policy is best served by applying the state blue sky law's two-year statute of limitations to a suit involving the fraudulent sale of securities. Newman v. Prior, 518 F.2d 97 (4th Cir. 1975), overruled on other grounds, Newcome v. Esrey, 862 F.2d 1099 (4th Cir. 1988).

       </p>
       <p>
        Stock sold by the sellers to the purchaser and two other people that gave the purchaser and two other people 100 percent control of the sellers' corporation was a security and, thus, the transaction was regulated by the provision under which the purchaser sued the sellers for allegedly misinforming the purchaser,
    
     §
    
    13.1-522. A security included, unless the context required otherwise, any stock and the stock involved in the transaction had the traditional indicia of stock, including dividends, negotiability, and voting rights. Andrews v. Browne, <cite class="va_code">276 Va. 141</cite>, 662 S.E.2d 58, 2008 Va. LEXIS 74 (2008).

       <p>
        Even when state law furnishes the period of limitation, federal law controls its commencement.

        - Although there were several original members of a company that was formed to create a restaurant, the individual members were not sellers of securities that other investors paid for, and under this section, only the actual seller, in this case the company, could be held liable to the investors for false and misleading statements made or omitted; specifically, the investors were never told that one member had previously had bankruptcies in the restaurant business.

        - Sellers of the stock in a corporation violated subsection A of
        §
        13.1-522 and thus were liable to the buyers for the consideration paid by the buyers for the corporation's stock, for interest on such consideration, for costs, and for reasonable attorney's fees.

The statute appeared to be directed at persons in the business of advising others as to the value of securities, but the sellers did not appear to fall into this category, at least not in the transaction's context; therefore, the court did not find that the sellers violated subsection B of

         Action to recover lost profits.
        </b>
        - Professional corporations are entitled to take advantage of various tax provisions available to all corporations. It is also true that professionals practicing in a professional corporation enjoy limited personal liability for wrongful acts committed by their fellow professionals in the corporation. Nevertheless, these corporate characteristics cannot be taken to suggest that in an action to recover lost profits the professional corporation must also prove damages in the same manner as any other corporation and end up in almost every case with little or no recovery.

         Unenforceability of derivative claims against attorney.
        </b>
        - District court did not err in suggesting that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC's) claims against attorney were derivative and therefore barred by this chapter. Attorney would be liable to the FDIC only to the extent that he is responsible for law firm's share of the liability, if any. Attorney could not be held personally liable if he was not personally responsible for any of the work done for the savings and loan. FDIC v. Cocke, 7 F.3d 396 (4th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 807, 115 S. Ct. 53, 130 L. Ed. 2d 12 (1994).

       It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Commonwealth, through the exercise by the General Assembly of its power to regulate commerce partly or wholly within the Commonwealth of Virginia, to correct as rapidly as practicable such inequities as may exist in the franchise system so as to establish a more even balance of power between franchisors and franchisees; to require franchisors to deal fairly with their franchisees with reference to all aspects of the franchise relationship and to provide franchisees more direct, simple, and complete judicial relief against franchisors who fail to deal in a lawful manner with them.

        - The purpose of the federal Automobile Dealers' Day in Court Act, 15 U.S.C.
        §§
        1221-1225 is to curtail abuse of dealers resulting from franchisors' vastly superior bargaining strength. The Retail Franchising Act is designed to effect a similar purpose. Turner v. Subaru of Am., Inc., 566 F. Supp. 143 (W.D. Va. 1983).

    - Provision which states that this chapter shall apply only to a franchise, the performance of which contemplates or requires the franchisee to establish or maintain a place of business within the Commonwealth of Virginia, simply requires the business transacted under the franchise agreement to have a nexus to the Commonwealth; the provision is not so restrictive, as to place the burden upon a party seeking protection of the act to show that a fixed physical site where business is transacted, such as a shop, office or warehouse, has been established.

Paragraph 18(c) plainly stated: "The Dealer has not paid any fee for this agreement."

        Editor's note.
       </b>
       - At its 1983 session, the General Assembly directed the Virginia Code Commission to make a careful study of Chapters 1 (
       §
       13.1-1 et seq.) and 2 (
       <span class="s1">
        §

       13.1-201 et seq.) of this title and to report its findings in the form of a revision. The report, entitled "Report of the Virginia Code Commission on the Revision of Chapters 1 and 2 of Title 13.1 of the Code of Virginia," was published as House Document 13 of the 1985 session, and contains revisor's notes and comments which, while valuable, are too voluminous for inclusion here. The Code Commission's draft of the revision formed the basis of Chapter 522 of the Acts of 1985, which repealed Chapters 1 and 2 of this title and enacted in lieu thereof Chapters 9 (

         "Distribution."
        </b>
        - The phrases "other acquisition of shares" and "or otherwise" demonstrate that the substance, and not the form of the transaction, determines whether a distribution occurred.
    In addition, granting a motion to dismiss would be inappropriate if any set of facts would support the characterization as a distribution. C-T of Va., Inc. v. Barrett, 124 Bankr. 689 (W.D. Va. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The inclusion of purchases, redemptions, and other acquisitions within this section's definition of distributions is not an indication that the statutory definition applies when all outstanding shares of the corporation are purchased at a market rate in the course of an arm's-length purchase of the corporation.

       means the failure to authorize, approve, or otherwise effect a corporate action in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the articles of incorporation or bylaws, a corporate resolution, or any plan or agreement to which the corporation is a party, if and to the extent such failure would render such corporate action voidable.

      <p>
       "Valid shares"
       means the shares of any class or series of the corporation that have been duly authorized and validly issued in accordance with this chapter, including as a result of ratification or validation under this article.

         Provisions limiting control of stockholders valid.
        </b>
        - The stockholders, by charter, gave a grant of plenary power to the directors for a certain time and thus bound themselves in advance to an affirmance of the acts of the directors, the intention being that the acts of the directors should bind the stockholders the same as if each stockholder had been present at the meeting of the directors and had voted as they did. The provisions of the charter are not in conflict with acts which provide for annual meetings of the stockholders, and for meetings by them at any time upon the call of those who hold at least one-tenth of the stock for this is intended to apply to those companies in whose charters there is no agreement to the contrary.

     Charter restrictions on sale or transfer of stock.
    </b>
    - Reasonable charter restrictions on the sale or transfer of stock, though strictly construed, are binding upon purchases of the stock upon the principle that the charter is a contract between the corporation and the stockholders and between the stockholders themselves. Monacan Hills, Inc. v. Page, <cite class="va_code">203 Va. 110</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 654 (1961).
       </p>

        Where possible failure to comply literally with certain charter restrictions on the sale of stock was due to a mistake by counsel for the corporation, the corporation was not permitted to assert the possible discrepancy against the purchaser of the stock.

         Attorney who acted as one party's agent not disqualified from representing other party.

        - The fact that an attorney acted as registered agent for a party does not support its motion to disqualify him from representing the other party. A registered agent may be any person over 18 who is either an officer or director of the corporation or a member of the Virginia State Bar or an appropriately registered professional corporation. As a practical matter, the single function of a registered agent is to act as the recipient of any process, notice, order or demand required or permitted by law, to be served upon the corporation. Such a function does not constitute the establishment of an attorney-client relationship. Chantilly Constr. Corp. v. John Driggs Co., 39 Bankr. 466 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1984) (decided under prior law).

Shareholders of Virginia corporations need not fear the coercive pressures of two-tiered tender offers or the prospect of corporate raiders seeking to extract greenmail by threatening to immediately dismantle and sell a corporation's assets.

     Threat of discharge unlawful as means to control voting by employee.
    </b>
    - Because the voting rights conferred by this section are in furtherance of established public policy, an employer could not lawfully use the threat of discharge, of an at-will employee as a device to control the otherwise unfettered discretion of a shareholder-employee to vote freely his or her stock in the corporation-employer. Consequently, the employee stated a cause of action in tort against the employer and its board of directors for improper discharge from employment. Bowman v. State Bank, <cite class="va_code">229 Va. 534</cite>, 331 S.E.2d 797 (1985), decided under former

        - Shareholder, before filing a derivative action, did not sufficiently demand redress of the alleged usurpation of corporate opportunities in the shareholder's written demands to a corporation, pursuant to subdivision B 1 of
        §
        13.1-672.1, because the wrongs alleged in the shareholder's written demands related to the corporation's financial records and the shareholder's lack of access to the records.

     Director cannot profit from transactions of the corporation.
    </b>
    - A director of a private corporation cannot directly or indirectly, in any transaction in which he is under a duty to guard the interests of the corporation, acquire any personal advantage, or make any profit for himself, and if he does so, he may be compelled to account therefor to the corporation. Giannotti v. Hamway, <cite class="va_code">239 Va. 14</cite>, 387 S.E.2d 725 (1990).

        <b>
     Under the business judgment rule, directors are presumed to have acted properly
    </b>
    and in good faith in the exercise of their business judgment, including the fixing of compensation, and are called to account for their actions only when they are shown to have engaged in self-dealing or fraud, or have acted in bad faith; however, when a plaintiff demonstrates that a director had an interest in the transaction at issue, the burden shifts to the director to prove that the transaction was fair and reasonable to the corporation.

     Bestowing of authority on officers.
    </b>
    - The powers of a private corporation so far as its dealings with third persons are concerned, are primarily lodged in its board of directors, from which source the officers, either expressly or by implication derive such authority as may be bestowed upon them. Clement v. Adams Bros.-Paynes Co., <cite class="va_code">113 Va. 546</cite>, 75 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 294</cite> (1912).

    </b>
    - The office of president itself confers no power to bind the corporation or control its property. His power as an agent comes as a delegation of authority from the bylaws or the board of directors. Crump v. United States Mining Co., 48 Va. (7 Gratt.) 352 (1851); Hodges v. First Nat'l Bank, 63 Va.

        A majority of the board of directors cannot undertake to act in their individual names for the board itself. They can only bind their railroad corporation by acting together as a board.

        <b>
     Individual directors are not agents of the corporation,
    </b>
    and it is well settled, therefore, that declarations and admissions of individual directors when not acting as a board are not binding on the corporation admissible as evidence against it, unless they were acting at the time as its authorized agents and within the scope of their authority. Curbstone admissions or declarations of an individual director do not have the effect of binding the corporation in the absence of evidence that authority to make such declarations was duly conferred.

         For decision to sue is one for directors.
        </b>
        - The decision of whether or not to institute legal proceedings on behalf of the corporation is commonly regarded as a matter of internal management to be left to the discretion of the directors. Abella v. Universal Leaf Tobacco Co., 495 F. Supp. 713 (E.D. Va. 1980), disapproved on other grounds on renewal of motions, 546 F. Supp. 795 (E.D. Va. 1982).

        <b>
         But shareholder may sue in a derivative capacity.
        </b>
        - Where the directors refuse to enforce the corporation's right in court, a shareholder may then sue in a derivative capacity only upon a showing either that the managing agents are themselves the authors of the wrong, or that their refusal to bring suit in the name of the corporation is an act of bad faith, or an abuse of the discretionary power vested in them. Abella v. Universal Leaf Tobacco Co., 495 F. Supp. 713 (E.D. Va. 1980), disapproved on other grounds on renewal of motions, 546 F. Supp. 795 (E.D. Va. 1982).

Abella v. Universal Leaf Tobacco Co., 495 F. Supp. 713 (E.D. Va. 1980), disapproved on other grounds on renewal of motions, 546 F. Supp. 795 (E.D. Va. 1982).

        - The Virginia takeover statutes do not completely eliminate the flow of interstate commerce in hostile takeover attempts of Virginia corporations.

Any potential acquiror that makes an adequate offer may gain control of a Virginia corporation; the Virginia statutes just make it more expensive to do so. WLR Foods, Inc. v.

        13.1-728.1 et seq., Virginia has given certain tools to shareholders and management, acting in the best interests of the corporation, to ensure that tender offers succeed only if they are consistent with the long-term interests of the corporation.

        - Decision making process engaged in by directors demonstrated that their actions were taken in compliance with their good faith business judgment of the best interests of the corporation. As a result, counterclaims alleging breaches of fiduciary duty must fail. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 869 F. Supp. 419 (W.D. Va. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment was granted in favor of defendants because plaintiffs failed to show that defendants breached their fiduciary duty as directors of the company because at the time defendants agreed to purchase plaintiffs' company, defendants' company was solvent and as such defendants' decision did not involve fraud, bad faith or unconscionable conduct; therefore, defendants were entitled to Virginia's business judgment rule,

     Protection only to acts or omissions as director.
    </b>
    - The protection of this section applies only to acts "taken as a director, or any failure to take any action," and is confined to the exercise of business judgment on behalf of the corporation; when the acts in question do not meet these criteria, this section does not apply.

         Personal liability of director found.
        </b>
        - Unless he complies with the applicable standards of conduct described in this section, a director who votes for or assents to a distribution made in violation of Chapter 9 of Title 13.1 of the Code is personally liable to the corporation and its creditors for the amount of the distribution that exceeds what could have been distributed without violating Chapter 9.

     No protection for organization of competitor.
    </b>
    - Clearly, the organization of a competitor was not a corporate act of the corporation of which the defendant was a director and, in taking this action, the director was not exercising business judgment on behalf of the corporation; although implicating a common-law duty of loyalty, this act did not fall within the scope of this section and the defendant was not entitled to protection under the statutory business judgment rule.

        <b>
         "Safe harbor" exception to director liability.
        </b>
        - Because section 13.1-692 conditions its imposition of personal liability upon a director's failure to comply with the standards of conduct described in this section, a "safe harbor" is provided to a director who does comply with those standards. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r v. Matyiko, 481 S.E.2d 468 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not abrogate the common law duties of a director but does set the standard by which a director is to discharge those duties; if a director acts in accordance with that standard, the statute provides a safe harbor that shields a director from liability for any action taken as a director and for failure to take action. Willard v. Moneta Bldg. Supply, Inc., <cite class="va_code">258 Va. 140</cite>, 515 S.E.2d 277 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section establishes the standard by which to evaluate a director's discharge of duties and, if a director acts in accordance with that standard, subsection C provides a "safe harbor" that shields him from liability for any action taken as a director, or any failure to take any action.

         Duty to obtain highest price for shareholders.
        </b>
        - It is well-established in corporate law that when the sale of a firm is inevitable, the directors' duty is to obtain the highest price for shareholders. C-T of Va., Inc. v. Barrett, 124 Bankr. 694 (W.D. Va. 1990), aff'd, 958 F.2d 606 (4th Cir. 1992).

         And duty cannot extend to interests of current or future unsecured creditors.
        </b>
        - Board of director's announcement that it had authorized the sale of the company to management in a leveraged buyout signalled that the company was for sale.
    At that point, the board was not merely considering a possibility of merger with a particular corporation; it had already determined that the best way to serve shareholder interests was to place the firm on the market. Accordingly, the directors' duties were limited to those specified by
        Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes Holding, Inc.
        , 506 A.2d 173 (Del. 1986):
    to gain the highest possible price for its shareholders; the duty cannot extend to the interests of current or future unsecured creditors of the company. C-T of Va., Inc. v. Barrett, 124 Bankr. 689 (W.D. Va. 1990).

       <p>
        <b>
     Directors may consider factors other than price.
    </b>
    - The directors of a corporation are entitled to consider the quantity and quality of offers to purchase the corporation's assets and are not required to accept an offer merely because it maximizes the purchase price; such a rule would mean that only one offer, among many, was in the best interests of the corporation and would erode the deference afforded a director's discharge of duties under the statute.

         "Good faith" under this section presents the question
        </b>
        of whether a process was engaged that would produce a defensible business decision. The procedural soundness of a business decision may be assessed by examining the qualifications of the persons with whom the director consulted; the general topics, not the substance, of the information sought or imparted; and, even whether the advice was followed. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 155 F.R.D. 142 (W.D. Va. 1994), aff'd, 65 F.3d 1172 (4th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1117, 116 S. Ct. 921, 133 L. Ed. 2d 850 (1996).

        A conflict of interests transaction is a transaction with the corporation in which a director of the corporation has an interest that precludes the director from being a disinterested director. A conflict of interests transaction is not voidable by the corporation solely because of the director's interest in the transaction if any one of the following is true:
        <ol>
         <li id="t13.1c09a09s13.1-691ol1A1">
          The material facts of the transaction and the director's interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors and the board of directors or committee authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction;
         </li>
         <li id="t13.1c09a09s13.1-691ol1A2">
          The material facts of the transaction and the director's interest were disclosed to the shareholders entitled to vote and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction; or

       </li>
       <li id="t13.1c09a09s13.1-691ol1B">
        For purposes of subdivision A 1, a conflict of interests transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors on the board of directors, or on the committee. A transaction shall not be authorized, approved, or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the disinterested directors vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director who is not disinterested does not affect the validity of any action taken under subdivision A 1 if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or ratified as provided in that subsection.

       <li id="t13.1c09a09s13.1-691ol1C">
        For purposes of subdivision A 2, a conflict of interests transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the shares entitled to be counted under this subsection. Shares owned by or voted under the control of a director who is not disinterested may not be counted in a vote of shareholders to determine whether to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interests transaction under subdivision A 2. The vote of those shares, however, shall be counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of this chapter. A majority of the shares, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section.

        13.1-39.1 when the General Assembly enacted this section. Under this section, transactions in which a director has an interest are not void, only voidable, a marked change from the previous statutory provision which rendered them void. Furthermore, a transaction in which a director has a direct or indirect interest is not voidable if certain statutory provisions apply. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 155 F.R.D. 142 (W.D.

         Transaction with corporation required for conflict of interests.
        </b>
        - This section defines a conflict of interests transaction as a transaction with the corporation, and there is no such transaction when the plaintiff alleges that the director caused the corporation to waive its right of first refusal with respect to the purchase of the plaintiff's stock and that the director thereafter purchased the stock as a private individual.

         Director conflict claim necessitates no knowledge of substance of advice given.
        </b>
        - Irrespective of who carries the initial burden of proof and when during the course of litigation it might shift, the bottom line is that none of the elements of a director conflict claim or defense involves the need for knowing the substance of advice given the director before or during a transaction. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 155 F.R.D. 142 (W.D. Va. 1994), aff'd, 65 F.3d 1172 (4th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1117, 116 S. Ct. 921, 133 L. Ed. 2d 850 (1996).

         Dealings of director with corporation closely scrutinized.

     Fairness of transaction.
    </b>
    - No inflexible rule can be established by which to test the fairness of a transaction but, generally, a director must act in good faith and the transaction must, as a whole, be open, fair and honest at the time it was consummated; a transaction in which a director has a conflict of interest should bear the earmarks of an arm's length bargain in order to be deemed fair to the corporation.

         Director may not acquire personal advantage or profit in breach of duty to corporation.
        </b>
        - A director of a private corporation cannot directly or indirectly, in any transaction in which he is under a duty to guard the interest of the corporation, acquire any personal advantage or make any profit for himself, and if he does so, he may be compelled to account therefor to the corporation. Tanner's Transf. & Storage of Va., Inc. v. Florance, 22 Bankr. 24 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982) (decided under prior law).

     When a conflict of interest exists, burden of proof shifts to directors.
    </b>
    - A party challenging the actions of the board of directors has the burden of proving that the challenged action was not undertaken in accordance with the directors' good faith business judgment of the best interests of the corporation; however, when a conflict of interest as defined in this section exists, the burden shifts to the directors to show that their actions complied with the requirements of that section.

         Shareholder in close corporation may challenge transaction.

        <b>
         Professional advice irrelevant.
        </b>
        - In judging the fairness to a corporation of an interested director transaction, the substance of professional advice given to and relied upon by a defendant is immaterial because such advice is not probative of the nature of the conflict, nor of whether the transaction was fair to the corporation; fairness must be established irrespective of advice sought or given. Byelick v. Vivadelli, 79 F. Supp. 2d 610 (E.D. Va. 1999).

         No duty existed for former member.
        </b>
        - Regarding a former member's claims against a limited liability company (LLC), equitable subordination was not warranted, because the LLC did not demonstrate a sufficient factual basis for the court to find inequitable conduct or harm since, inter alia, the court could not conclude that the former member breached the duty to refrain from self-dealing since the court could not find that such duty existed. In re Virginia Broadband, LLC, 521 Bankr. 539, 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 4638 (Bankr. W.D. Va. Nov. 5, 2014), aff'd, 538 Bankr. 253, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122638 (W.D. Va. 2015).

         Sufficiency of derivative claim.

        - Shareholder's derivative conflict of interest claim against directors survived dismissal because the shareholder met its initial burden of asserting a conflict of interest among the directors and whether defendants could assert a full disclosure defense involved a question of fact that could not be resolved on a motion to dismiss. DCG&T ex rel. Battaglia v. Knight, 68 F. Supp. 3d 579, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174996 (E.D. Va. Dec. 18, 2014), appeal dismissed, 648 Fed. Appx. 342, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 8816 (4th Cir. Va. 2016).

        - Although the decisions to establish defendant's compensation as CEO of a small corporation, initially grant defendant an interest-free loan, and not call the loan prior to a decedent shareholder's death were not protected by the business judgment doctrine because they were conflict-of-interest transactions, those decisions were protected and/or were cured as allowed by statute. However, the decision not to call the loan due once demanded was an improper discharge of defendant's duties as a director that was not cured by an applicable statutory provision. O'Brien v.

         Corporation's board of directors liability for a distribution must depend entirely on their premerger actions.
        </b>
        Where the uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that the directors intended to transfer ownership of the corporation as a going enterprise and were not seeking to hide a distribution of the firm's assets to the shareholders, no unlawful distribution occurred.
    Further, to the extent the events associated with the buyout might have been considered a distribution, the defendants were no longer directors at the time it was approved by the board, so they could not be held liable.

        - Where a majority shareholder directed that only a small portion of the proceeds from the sale of corporate property be wired to pay other debts into the corporate account, while instructing the buyer to wire the remaining amounts (more than 90 percent of the total paid at the sale) into his and a director's personal bank accounts, this evidence not only showed that the shareholder was aware of the collection proceedings against the corporation, but that the acts of procuring a significant personal and pecuniary benefit from the sale of the corporate property were illegal to warrant personal liability to the corporation's debtors and an insurer, who had paid the corporate debt and became subrogated to a federal judgment creditor.

     §
    
    13.1-724 explicitly permits a corporation to create a lower voting threshold, but only by amending the articles of incorporation; subject to some exceptions, the Virginia Stock Corporation Act only allows a corporation to amend its articles of incorporation by a vote of more than two-thirds of the shareholders.

     Title sanctions power of directors to amend bylaws.
    </b>
    - This title gives statutory sanction to developing corporate law by giving the board of directors, in managing the corporation, the power to amend or repeal bylaws in the absence of a reservation of this power to the shareholders in the articles of incorporation. Scott County Tobacco Whses., Inc. v. Harris, <cite class="va_code">214 Va. 508</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 780 (1974).

        <b>
     But there is danger of usurpation of shareholder control.
    </b>
    - Inherent in granting power to a board of directors to amend the instrument regulating the intracorporate balance of power is the danger of usurpation of shareholder control of those matters which may be most vital to their protection. Scott County Tobacco Whses., Inc. v. Harris, <cite class="va_code">214 Va. 508</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 780 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The capacity of a board of directors to increase or decrease the number of directors through bylaw amendment is an opportunity to effect usurpation of shareholder control of matters vital to their protection. Scott County Tobacco Whses., Inc. v. Harris, <cite class="va_code">214 Va. 508</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 780 (1974).

         Directors cannot alter bylaw imposing limitation on them.
        </b>
        - Though a bylaw of a corporation authorizes the directors to alter or amend the bylaws, the directors have no authority under said bylaw or otherwise to disregard or alter another bylaw which was intended to impose a limitation on their powers. Stevens v. Davison, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 819 (1868).

       <p>
        <b>
     Section 13.1-677 prevents the directors, by amending the bylaws to decrease the number of directors, from curtailing the term of duly elected directors.
    </b>
    In this way, a board's ability to alter its composition between annual meetings is restricted, while the benefits of amending bylaws in absence of a reservation of power to the shareholders still obtain.

    - The provisions as to merger and consolidation in earlier statutes were held applicable to corporations created by the laws of this State before the Constitution of 1902 was proclaimed, but which had been brought under the provisions of the Constitution by accepting amendments of their charters. Winfree v. Riverside Cotton Mills, <cite class="va_code">113 Va. 717</cite>, 75 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 309</cite> (1912).

     Right of stockholder to vote pending consummation of merger.

    - Nothing in the statutes relative to corporate mergers limits the fundamental right of a stockholder to vote pending consummation of a merger, whether he be a dissenting or an approving stockholder. Not until consummation of the merger and payment or provision for payment for their stock, do dissenting stockholders lose their normal rights in the merging corporation. Fein v.

        13.1-717 contemplates that "share exchanges" may consist of pure share-for-cash deals, such as those used in "cash-out" mergers. Thus, in proposing such a forced share exchange, the merger plan triggered the separate class voting requirement of subdivision F. 2. of this section, and plaintiffs' argument that their merger proposal need be approved by only a majority vote of Class A and Class B shareholders voting together as a single group, and not as separate groups, failed.

     Revocation of merged carrier's certificate.
    </b>
    - When a household carrier merged, it ceased to exist as a corporation, thus it necessarily follows that the carrier ceased to furnish services as a household goods carrier. Failure to furnish such services without Commission approval amounted to "discontinuance of service" in violation of the Commission rules and regulations. This action is willful within the meaning of former
    
     §
    
    56-338.12, since the merger was approved by both corporations through resolutions of their boards of directors. Hence, the Commission had authority to revoke the certificate of the merged carrier. Metro Van &amp; Storage Co. v.

        After adopting the plan of domestication the board of directors shall submit the plan to the shareholders for their approval.

        If the approval of the shareholders is to be sought at a shareholders meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, regardless of whether entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the plan of domestication is to be submitted for approval. The notice shall state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan of domestication and shall contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. The notice shall include or be accompanied by a copy of the articles of incorporation and the bylaws as they will be in effect immediately after the domestication.

        Unless the articles of incorporation or the board of directors, acting pursuant to subdivision 3, require a greater vote, approval of the plan of domestication requires (i) the approval of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum exists consisting of more than two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the plan and (ii) except as provided in subdivision 6, the approval of each class or series of shares voting as a separate voting group at the meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists consisting of more than two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the plan by that voting group. The articles of incorporation may provide for a greater or lesser vote than that provided for in this section so long as the vote provided for is not less than a majority of all votes cast on the plan by each voting group entitled to vote on the plan at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists.

        If as a result of a domestication one or more shareholders of a domestic domesticating corporation would become subject to interest holder liability, approval of the plan of domestication shall require the signing in connection with the domestication, by each such shareholder, of a separate written consent to become subject to such interest holder liability, unless in the case of a shareholder that already has interest holder liability with respect to the domesticating corporation, the terms and conditions of the interest holder liability with respect to the domesticated corporation are substantially identical to those of the existing interest holder liability, other than for changes that eliminate or reduce such interest holder liability.
       </li>

       In submitting the plan of domestication to the shareholders for approval, the board of directors shall recommend that the shareholders approve the plan, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors shall inform the shareholders of the basis for that determination.

The corporation will conclusively be deemed to have retained a significant continuing business activity if it retains a business activity that represented, for the corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (i) at least 20 percent of total assets at the end of the most recently completed fiscal year, and (ii) at least 20 percent of either (a) income from continuing operations before taxes or (b) revenues from continuing operations, in each case for the most recently completed fiscal year.

The notice shall also state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the disposition and shall contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the agreement pursuant to which the disposition will be effected.

The articles of incorporation may provide for a greater or lesser vote than that provided for in this subsection or a vote by separate voting groups so long as the vote provided for is not less than a majority of all the votes cast on the disposition by each voting group entitled to vote on the disposition at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists.

     §
    
    13.1-724 explicitly permits a corporation to create a lower voting threshold, but only by amending the articles of incorporation; subject to some exceptions, the Virginia Stock Corporation Act only allows a corporation to amend its articles of incorporation by a vote of more than two-thirds of the shareholders. Thus, if shareholders want to downgrade a supermajority voting threshold to a simple majority, they must amend the articles of incorporation by that same supermajority. May v. R.A. Yancey Lumber Corp., <cite class="va_code">297 Va. 1</cite>, 822 S.E.2d 358, 2019 Va. LEXIS 1 (Jan. 10, 2019).

    - The legislature has power to authorize a corporation to sell all of its assets for cash or securities with the consent of two-thirds of the stockholders of each class of stock.

    - The law is well settled that a mere alienation of all property of a corporation does not terminate its existence. Craddock-Terry Co. v. Powell, <cite class="va_code">181 Va. 417</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 363 (1943) (decided under prior law).

         Removal of corporate assets by sole stockholder.
        </b>
        - Although a corporation may have ownership rights separate from its stockholders, it is the directors and stockholders who control and exercise those rights. Thus, when a sole stockholder elects to remove corporate assets, his decision cannot be deemed a criminal deprivation of someone else's property rights. Instead, it is an exercise of rights that are lawfully within his control. If the decision he made was financially imprudent, unfair or dishonest, then he may be civilly liable for violations of his fiduciary obligations to creditors or criminally liable under tax and bankruptcy laws. The court would refuse, however, to extend the corporate legal fiction to mean that a sole stockholder could be guilty of stealing, converting or fraudulently taking corporate property over which he alone maintained control.

     Safe harbor.
    </b>
    - Safe harbor provision states that if a corporation retains a business activity that represented at least 20 percent of total assets at the end of the most recently completed fiscal year and 20 percent of income or revenue from continuing operations for that fiscal year, the corporation will conclusively be deemed to have retained a significant continuing business activity, and in such an instance, the disposition does not require a more than two-thirds shareholder vote. May v. R.A. Yancey Lumber Corp., <cite class="va_code">297 Va. 1</cite>, 822 S.E.2d 358, 2019 Va. LEXIS 1 (Jan. 10, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Safe harbor provision provides for an exception to the statutory threshold by use of the language "unless the articles of incorporation or a shareholder-approved bylaw otherwise provide"; thus, the statute allows a corporation to opt out of the statutory safe harbor threshold. May v. R.A. Yancey Lumber Corp., <cite class="va_code">297 Va. 1</cite>, 822 S.E.2d 358, 2019 Va. LEXIS 1 (Jan. 10, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Safe harbor provision states a default threshold; there is no statutory language that states or implies that an alternative threshold stated in an article of incorporation or a bylaw should be deemed sufficient to satisfy the significant continuing business activity requirement as a matter of law; language in the safe harbor provision providing for an exception to the threshold does not give a corporation authority to amend or create a new threshold that will be deemed sufficient to constitute a significant continuing business activity. May v. R.A. Yancey Lumber Corp., <cite class="va_code">297 Va. 1</cite>, 822 S.E.2d 358, 2019 Va. LEXIS 1 (Jan. 10, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment stated a safe harbor threshold different from that approved by the General Assembly, which showed the corporation's intent to opt out of the statutory threshold, and even if the corporation satisfied its arbitrary threshold created by the amendment, that would not necessarily be sufficient to satisfy the significant continuing business activity requirement; the circuit court erred in not determining whether the proposed sale factually left the corporation without a significant continuing business activity. May v. R.A. Yancey Lumber Corp., <cite class="va_code">297 Va. 1</cite>, 822 S.E.2d 358, 2019 Va. LEXIS 1 (Jan. 10, 2019).

     Temporary injunction.

    - Although the circuit court properly considered the timing of the filing of the request for a temporary injunction in weighing the equity of granting the injunction, it abused its discretion when it found that laches barred the request for a temporary injunction; to the extent the circuit court based its ruling regarding the temporary injunction upon laches and its misinterpretation of the statute, it erred in doing so.

        13.1-728.1 et seq., Virginia has given certain tools to shareholders and management, acting in the best interests of the corporation, to ensure that tender offers succeed only if they are consistent with the long-term interests of the corporation. Shareholders of Virginia corporations need not fear the coercive pressures of two-tiered tender offers or the prospect of corporate raiders seeking to extract greenmail by threatening to immediately dismantle and sell a corporation's assets.

        - The Virginia legislature apparently intended the Affiliated Transactions Act to protect minority shareholders from self-dealing by the majority and to discourage corporate raiders from using a target corporation's assets for the raider's own devices or from extracting greenmail from the target. Like the Control Share Act (
        §
        13.1-728.1 et seq.), the Affiliated Transactions Act gives independent shareholders a tool to prevent abuses by an acquiror. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277 (W.D. Va. 1994).

       Except as expressly provided in this article, the provisions of this article shall not limit actions that may be taken, or require the taking of any action, by the board of directors or shareholders with respect to any potential change in control of the corporation. With respect to any action or any failure to act by the board of directors, the provisions of § 13.1-690 shall apply. In determining the best interests of the corporation, a director may consider the possibility that those interests may best be served by the continued independence of the corporation.

      </p>
      <p>
       "Acquiring person,"
       with respect to any public corporation, means any person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition of shares of such public corporation.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Beneficial ownership"
       means the sole or shared power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares, or the sole or shared power to vote or direct the voting of shares, or the sole or shared power to acquire shares, including any such power that is not immediately exercisable, whether such power is direct or indirect or through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise. A person shall not be deemed to be a beneficial owner of shares tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by such person until the tendered shares are accepted for purchase or exchange. A person shall not be deemed to be a beneficial owner of shares as to which such person may exercise voting power solely by virtue of a revocable proxy conferring the right to vote. A member of a national securities exchange shall not be deemed to be a beneficial owner of shares held directly or indirectly by it on behalf of another person solely because such member is the record holder of such securities and, pursuant to the rules of such exchange, may direct the vote of such shares, without instructions, on other than contested matters or matters that may affect substantially the rights or privileges of the holders of the shares to be voted but is otherwise precluded by the rules of such exchange from voting without instructions.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Control share acquisition"
       means the direct or indirect acquisition, other than in an excepted acquisition, by any person of beneficial ownership of shares of a public corporation that, except for this article, would have voting rights and would, when added to all other shares of such public corporation which then have voting rights and are beneficially owned by such person, would cause such person to become entitled, immediately upon acquisition of such shares, to vote or direct the vote of, shares having voting power within any of the following ranges of the votes entitled to be cast in an election of directors: (i) one-fifth or more but less than one-third of such votes; (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority of such votes; or (iii) a majority or more of such votes. If voting rights are granted pursuant to this article in respect of any such range to shares so acquired by any person, any acquisition by such person of additional shares shall not, for purposes of the preceding sentence, constitute a control share acquisition unless, as a result of such acquisition, the voting power of the shares beneficially owned by such person would be in excess of such range in respect of which voting rights had previously been granted. If this article applies to acquisitions of shares of a public corporation at the time of a control share acquisition of any shares of such corporation, then shares acquired by the same person within 90 days before or after such control share acquisition and shares acquired by the same person pursuant to a plan to make a control share acquisition are deemed to have been acquired in the same control share acquisition for the purposes of this article, regardless of the applicability of this article at the time of any other acquisitions of shares during such periods or pursuant to such a plan.
       <br/>

       "Interested shares"
       means the shares of a public corporation the voting of which in an election of directors may be exercised or directed by any of the following persons: (i) an acquiring person with respect to a control share acquisition; (ii) any officer of such public corporation; or (iii) any employee of such public corporation who is also a director of the corporation.

       The
       "votes"
       entitled to be cast by any share shall, if any voting group is entitled to vote for less than the total number of directors to be elected at any election, be determined by multiplying the number of votes entitled to be cast by the holder of such share by the number of directors for whom such holder is entitled to vote; however, beneficial ownership of a majority of the shares comprising any such voting group shall be deemed to entitle such beneficial owner to cast all the votes of the shares in such voting group.

     "Fair value" defined.
    </b>
    - The term "fair value" of the stock of a stockholder who dissents from a sale means the intrinsic worth of the dissenter's stock, which is to be arrived at after an appraisal of all the elements of value. Lucas v. Pembroke Water Co., <cite class="va_code">205 Va. 84</cite>, 135 S.E.2d 147 (1964).

        <b>
     Elements of "fair value."
    </b>
    - Among the elements to be considered in arriving at the "fair value" or "fair cash value" of a dissenter's stock are its market value, net asset value, investment value, and earning capacity. Lucas v. Pembroke Water Co., <cite class="va_code">205 Va. 84</cite>, 135 S.E.2d 147 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        The book value, or net asset value, of the stock is only one of the factors to be considered. Mere book value alone is not determinative. Lucas v. Pembroke Water Co., <cite class="va_code">205 Va. 84</cite>, 135 S.E.2d 147 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Excessive salary payments to officers and directors of a corporation are assets of the corporation to be considered along with other assets in fixing the value of the stock. Lucas v. Pembroke Water Co., <cite class="va_code">205 Va. 84</cite>, 135 S.E.2d 147 (1964).

     "Fair cash value" means actual value.

     Purpose of statutes.
    </b>
    - The design of the statutes relating to the rights of a dissenting stockholder is to assure him that he will be fully compensated for the value of that of which he has been deprived by the merger, and no more. Adams v. United States Distrib. Corp., <cite class="va_code">184 Va. 134</cite>, 34 S.E.2d 244 (1945), cert. denied, 327 U.S. 788, 66 S. Ct. 807, 90 L. Ed. 1014 (1946).

        <b>
     Stockholder has election as to dissent.
    </b>
    - Every stockholder of a merging corporation has an election either to dissent and secure in the prescribed manner the fair cash value of his stock or, if he fails to dissent, to be bound by the terms of the merger. Adams v. United States Distrib. Corp., <cite class="va_code">184 Va. 134</cite>, 34 S.E.2d 244 (1945), cert. denied, 327 U.S. 788, 66 S. Ct. 807, 90 L. Ed. 1014 (1946); Pittston Co. v.

     Exclusiveness of statutory remedy.
    </b>
    - Unless a corporate merger be tainted with fraud or illegality, the dissenting stockholder must pursue the remedy prescribed by statute. Adams v. United States Distrib. Corp., <cite class="va_code">184 Va. 134</cite>, 34 S.E.2d 244 (1945), cert. denied, 327 U.S. 788, 66 S. Ct. 807, 90 L. Ed. 1014 (1946), wherein the court expressly refused to agree with Weiss v. Atkins, 52 F. Supp. 418 (S.D.N.Y. 1943), rev'd, 149 F.2d 193 (2nd Cir. 1945), and pointed out that Winfree v. Riverside Cotton Mills, <cite class="va_code">113 Va. 717</cite>, 75 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 309</cite> (1912), holding contra, was no longer applicable. See McGhee v. General Fin. Corp., 84 F. Supp. 24 (W.D. Va. 1949), holding that the remedy is available only in state courts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions of former law in regard to the valuation of the interest of dissatisfied members or stockholders in case of the merger of their corporation with another, were held to apply only in those cases in which the corporations seeking to merge had proceeded in all respects by authority of law. The provisions, therefore, were not exclusive of the right of dissatisfied members to contest the validity of an order of merger by the State Corporation Commission claimed to be destructive of their rights and interests, and utterly without warrant of law. Jones v. Rhea, <cite class="va_code">130 Va. 345</cite>, 107 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 814</cite> (1921).

Craddock-Terry Co. v. Powell, <cite class="va_code">181 Va. 417</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 363 (1943); Pittston Co. v.

     Appraisal rights not triggered.
    </b>
    - Circuit court did not err in granting a corporation's demurrer because changing the corporation's domicile from Virginia to Delaware did not trigger appraisal rights where Virginia did not include appraisal rights upon consummation of a domestication, Delaware did not provide appraisal rights for a sale of corporate assets, and recognition of the substance-over-form or step-transaction doctrines would not change the statutes.

        §
        13.1-740 is incorporated into the contract between Virginia corporations and their shareholders, and hence constitutes a contractual forum selection clause. In other words, when an individual purchases a share of stock in a Virginia corporation, the individual, in effect, enters into a contract with the corporation, and this contract incorporates the general corporation law of Virginia; thus, when an individual purchases stock in a Virginia corporation the individual has constructive notice that the individual is bound by the terms of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act,

     No discretion in Commission.
    </b>
    - Upon the filing of a certificate of unanimous consent of stockholders to the dissolution of a corporation, with the State Corporation Commission, the sole question before that body was whether the company had complied with the law entitling it to a certificate of dissolution. If it had, it was the duty of the Commission to issue the certificate, and no court (except on appeal) could enter any order that would "interfere with the Commission in the performance of its official duties" (Va. Const., former
    
     §
    
    156). And the appointment of a receiver for the corporation between the filing of the certificate of consent and its final amendment as to signature and execution, is no reason for refusing a certificate of dissolution, if otherwise it should have been granted.

     The word "oppressive"
    </b>
    does not necessarily savor of fraud, and the absence of "mismanagement, or misapplication of assets," does not prevent a finding that the conduct of the dominant directors or officers has been oppressive. White v. Perkins, <cite class="va_code">213 Va. 129</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 315 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        "Oppressive" is not synonymous with "illegal" and "fraudulent." White v. Perkins, <cite class="va_code">213 Va. 129</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 315 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word "oppressive," as used in this section does not carry an essential inference of imminent disaster; it can contemplate a continuing course of conduct. White v. Perkins, <cite class="va_code">213 Va. 129</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 315 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        As used in this section, "oppressive" means conduct by corporate managers toward stockholders which departs from the standards of fair dealing and violates the principles of fair play on which persons who entrust their funds to a corporation are entitled to rely.
    The term does not mean that a corporate disaster may be imminent and does not necessarily mean fraudulent conduct.
    Indeed, "oppressive" is not synonymous with the statutory terms "illegal" or "fraudulent."
    The term can contemplate a continuous course of conduct and includes a lack of probity in corporate affairs to the prejudice of some of its shareholders. Giannotti v. Hamway, <cite class="va_code">239 Va. 14</cite>, 387 S.E.2d 725 (1990) (decided under former

        <b>
     Weight of chancellor's finding of oppressive conduct.
    </b>
    - A finding of fact by the chancellor, hearing evidence ore tenus that conduct was oppressive under this section carries the weight of a jury verdict, and cannot be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. White v. Perkins, <cite class="va_code">213 Va. 129</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 315 (1972).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Procedure upon finding oppression.
    </b>
    - It is clear from this section that the court, upon finding oppression, could have decreed dissolution. It is also clear that it could have appointed a custodian with power to continue the business, including the payment of dividends, if the chancellor was convinced from the evidence that this action was in the best interest of the stockholders. White v. Perkins, <cite class="va_code">213 Va. 129</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 315 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon a finding of oppression under this section, it was error for the trial court to decree: that the corporation should declare a dividend; that the majority stockholder's claims against the company should be disallowed; that the amount owing to the company by a business controlled by the majority stockholder should be kept reasonably current in the future; and that the minority stockholder, whose employment with the company had been terminated, should be paid severance pay. White v. Perkins, <cite class="va_code">213 Va. 129</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 315 (1972).

     Power of courts of equity.
    </b>
    - The General Assembly has cloaked courts of equity with, in the words of the statute, "full power" to liquidate in a proper case where oppressive conduct has been established.
    The remedy specified by the legislature, while discretionary, is exclusive, and does not permit the trial court to fashion other, apparently equitable remedies. Giannotti v. Hamway, <cite class="va_code">239 Va. 14</cite>, 387 S.E.2d 725 (1990) (decided under former

     Intervention of court not justified.
    </b>
    - In action by majority stockholder to dissolve corporation because the principal purpose for which corporation was formed was alleged to have failed, it was held that the circumstances revealed by the evidence did not justify the intervention of a court of equity in the internal affairs of the corporation and a substitution of its judgment for the judgment of the board of directors.

        An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court at any time within 90 days after the filing of the petition under subdivision A 1 of § 13.1-747 or at such later time as the court in its discretion may allow. If the election to purchase is filed by one or more shareholders, the corporation shall, within 10 days thereafter, give written notice to all shareholders, other than the petitioner. The notice shall state the name and number of shares owned by the petitioner and the name and number of shares owned by each electing shareholder and shall advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase shares in accordance with this section. Shareholders who wish to participate shall file notice of their intention to join in the purchase no later than 30 days after the effectiveness of the notice to them. All shareholders who have filed an election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to purchase thereby become parties to the proceeding and shall participate in the purchase in proportion to their ownership of outstanding shares as of the date the first election was filed, unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs. After an election has been filed by the corporation or one or more shareholders, the proceeding under subdivision A 1 of § 13.1-747 may not be discontinued or settled, nor may the petitioning shareholder sell or otherwise dispose of the petitioner's shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the corporation and the shareholders, other than the petitioner, to permit such discontinuance, settlement, sale, or other disposition.

        If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in subsection C, the court, upon application of any party, shall stay the proceedings under subdivision A 1 of § 13.1-747 and determine the fair value of the petitioner's shares as of the day before the date on which the petition under subdivision A 1 of § 13.1-747 was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances. The determination of fair value shall include consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, including, unless the court determines it would be unjust or inequitable to do so, (i) the petitioner's minority status, (ii) the marketability of the petitioner's shares, (iii) the relevant terms of any shareholders' agreement, and (iv) if the court finds that the value of the corporation has been diminished by the wrongful conduct of controlling shareholders, the petitioner's proportionate claim for any compensable corporate injury. In determining the fair value, the court may, in its discretion, select an appraiser to appraise the fair value of the petitioner's shares and shall assess the cost of any such appraisal to the parties, to the corporation, or both, as the equities may appear to the court.

        Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments, where necessary in the interests of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional costs, fees and expenses as may have been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among them. In allocating petitioner's shares among holders of different classes of shares, the court should attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of a specific class or classes shall not participate in the purchase. Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed. If the court finds that the petitioning shareholder had probable grounds for relief under subdivision A 1 b or d of § 13.1-747, it may award expenses to the petitioning shareholder.

         Effect of termination of corporate existence.
        </b>
        - A corporate dissolution (now termination of corporate existence), by operation of law, under this "unique" Virginia statute, has the legal effect of causing a de jure dissolution (now termination of corporate existence) of the corporation as opposed to a de facto dissolution (now termination of corporate existence), because the statute declares a corporation thus delinquent shall ipso facto cease to exist. Moore v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n, 591 F.2d 991 (4th Cir. 1979) (decided under prior law).

         Under this section, an automatic dissolution (now termination of corporate existence) works a forfeiture of the corporate charter

        by operation of law, thereby stripping the corporation's legal mandate to exist. Moore v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n, 591 F.2d 991 (4th Cir. 1979) (decided under prior law).

        If a Virginia corporation fails to pay its annual registration fee by September 1, the corporation is automatically terminated. An automatic dissolution under this section works a forfeiture of the corporate charter by operation of law, thereby stripping the corporation's legal mandate to exist. A dissolved domestic corporation is no corporation at all. Hudgins v. IRS, 132 Bankr. 115 (E.D. Va. 1991), modified, 967 F.2d 973 (4th Cir. 1992).

         Upon dissolution directors become trustees of corporate assets.
        </b>
        - Upon dissolution, the directors no longer function as directors of a corporation. This section provides that they become trustees in dissolution. The assets of the corporation automatically pass to them in their new capacity. This is the res of the trust they must administer. Flip Mtg. Corp. v. McElhone, 841 F.2d 531 (4th Cir. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Virginia Code, when a corporation is terminated for failure to pay its annual registration fees, the assets of the corporation pass to the directors as trustees in liquidation. The trustees are charged with disposing of the corporate assets, discharging the corporation's debts, and distributing the remainder of the assets to the shareholders. The debts referred to by this section are the pre-existing debts of the corporation. Hudgins v. IRS, 132 Bankr. 115 (E.D. Va. 1991), modified, 967 F.2d 973 (4th Cir. 1992).

         Director's liability.
        </b>
        - People dealing with a corporation are obliged to look to the corporation for satisfaction of their claims; only in extraordinary circumstances are directors liable for corporate debts and this section and
        §
        13.1-754 must be construed in a manner consistent with the strong public policy of shielding directors from individual liability for corporate debt and these sections do not impose any liability for corporate debt on the directors simply because the corporation has been automatically dissolved. Even after dissolution, the directors are shielded from individual liability if they discharge the duties the statute places on them to marshal assets, pay pre-existing debts, and distribute the remaining funds, if any, to the shareholders. Moreover, the directors may temporarily continue the corporate business as an incident to its liquidation without incurring individual liability. The directors' difficulty arises when they violate the law and carry on the business instead of liquidating it. They then become personally liable. Flip Mtg. Corp. v. McElhone, 841 F.2d 531 (4th Cir. 1988).

       <p>
        Any actions performed by the directors or officers after dissolution, if not related to the process of winding up the corporation's affairs, should be deemed individual actions, with concomitant individual liability therefor.

        This section, the Virginia corporate dissolution (now termination of corporate existence) statute, by its terms requires a finding of personal responsibility on the part of the corporate directors for any liability created by any normal continuance of the corporate business after dissolution (now termination of corporate existence).

         Legislative intent.
        </b>
        - The legislature intended that once a corporation achieves reinstatement, its corporate status relates back to the date of its termination and it is as if the corporation had never been terminated and debtor's action to achieve reinstatement after the filing of the petition for Chapter 11 supports its eligibility for Chapter 11 relief since, in the eyes of the State, it has been a corporation all along.

         Director's liability.
        </b>
        - People dealing with a corporation are obliged to look to the corporation for satisfaction of their claims and only in extraordinary circumstances are directors liable for corporate debts. Section 13.1-752 and this section must be construed in a manner consistent with the strong public policy of shielding directors from individual liability for corporate debt and these sections do not impose any liability for corporate debt on the directors simply because the corporation has been automatically dissolved. Even after dissolution, the directors are shielded from individual liability if they discharge the duties the statute places on them to marshal assets, pay pre-existing debts, and distribute the remaining funds, if any, to the shareholders. Moreover, the directors may temporarily continue the corporate business as an incident to its liquidation without incurring individual liability. The directors' difficulty arises when they violate the law and carry on the business instead of liquidating it. They then become personally liable. Flip Mtg. Corp. v. McElhone, 841 F.2d 531 (4th Cir. 1988).

         Liability of directors for actions taken between termination of corporate existence and reinstatement.

       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for damages by an information technology company and its sole owner against a former partner, his wife, and their new corporation, the trial court did not err in refusing to strike all of plaintiffs' evidence because the information technology company's corporate existence was terminated during the time of the alleged wrong where the company's reinstatement following termination had the retroactive effect of placing it in a position as if its termination had never occurred.

        - Language of this section, the Virginia reinstatement statute, is quite clear that reinstatement has no effect on any question of personal liability of the directors. Moore v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n, 591 F.2d 991 (4th Cir. 1979) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section makes the revived corporation liable for any liabilities incurred in the interim period, but it declares at the same time, in unmistakable terms, that reinstatement will not relieve the directors of the personal liability they have already incurred by continuing the normal operations of the corporation during dissolution. Moore v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n, 591 F.2d 991 (4th Cir. 1979) (decided under prior law).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a party alleges that the business affairs of a dissolved corporation have been carried on by the acts of certain officers, directors, or agents of the dissolved corporation, then those officers, directors, or agents can be held personally liable for contracts entered on behalf of the dissolved corporation. Any such personal liability incurred because of acts done during the period of corporate dissolution is not relieved by the reinstatement of the corporation. McLean Bank v. Nelson, <cite class="va_code">232 Va. 420</cite>, 350 S.E.2d 651 (1986).

        - A corporation cannot escape liability where, although the injury plaintiff complains of is related to a product purchased from defendant corporation, prior to dissolution, the claim did not arise until the injury occurred and the injury asserted occurred after dissolution. That result would be inconsistent with the clear intent of this section to abrogate the common-law rule which absolves a corporation of any liability once that corporation is dissolved. Oliver v.

        A claim against a corporation must have existed or the liability of a corporation must have been incurred prior to the date of the corporation's termination in order for the claim or liability to survive the termination.

        13.1-758 imports the transaction of its ordinary and customary business herein.

     Business need not be commercial.

    - A patriotic, secret, social, benevolent, and foreign corporation, which established local organizations, initiated members and furnished them with paraphernalia, was exercising its functions and powers within this State, under the provisions of the statutes, and was therefore subject to the provisions thereof.

        A foreign corporation which solicits members, organizes lodges, distributes regalia, collects fees, and makes such contracts as are involved in or incidental to these acts, is protected under the provisions of law of this State, and the indirect connection with anything which could be fairly held to be interstate commerce is too remote to relieve it from the provisions of the statutes relating to foreign corporations.

        A foreign corporation which made a contract for the sale, installation and erection of certain gas machines and equipments in this State, involving extensive construction work, was doing business in this State, and therefore liable under
        §
        13.1-758 for having failed to take out license therefor; the essence of the undertaking was the construction engaged in, the sale being a mere incident thereto. Commonwealth ex rel. SCC v. Western Gas Constr. Co., 11 Va. L. Reg. (n.s.) 737 (1926).

        A manufacturer which shipped goods on consignment to its exclusive distributor in Virginia, and, when the goods were sold by the distributor on conditional sales contracts, accepted assignment of the conditional sales contracts from the distributor, was not, under the facts, doing business in this State so as to subject it to the requirements of this article.

        Entering into a purchase agreement for the sale of land to be used as a future manufacturing site does not constitute "transacting business" within the statutory meaning of this section or

Neither do the incidentals associated therewith, such as negotiating with and entering into construction contracts with an architectural firm, a general construction firm and a real estate development and investment firm such as plaintiff.

In the context of an alleged misappropriation of a trade name, the reality of a building and loan association's "doing business" ought to be considered by the court. Kyhos v.

     Engaging in business subjects foreign corporation to jurisdiction of state courts.

    - When a foreign corporation engages in the privilege of doing business in Virginia, it enjoys the benefits and protection of the laws of this Commonwealth. It thereby subjects itself to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State for the purpose of litigating liabilities created during its stay here. Eure v.

        Defendant was a Massachusetts corporation with the principal office in New York. It had not been domesticated in Virginia, had no resident agent here, and had not designated the Secretary of the Commonwealth (now the Clerk of the Commission) as its agent for service of process. Under such circumstances, it was necessary that defendant be engaged in business in the State in order to validate service upon it under this section which provides for service only if a corporation is so engaged.

        - To conduct business in Virginia, a foreign corporation must merely register with the State Corporation Commission. However, a foreign corporation must reincorporate in Virginia in order to act as a public service company. Johnson v. Colonial Pipeline Co., 830 F. Supp. 309 (E.D. Va. 1993).

         Diversity jurisdiction lacking in action against pipeline company.
        </b>
        - Even though pipeline company defendant was incorporated in Virginia, and its Virginia incorporation was an involuntary addition to its incorporation in Delaware, both plaintiffs and the defendant were citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and thus diversity jurisdiction was lacking under
        §
        56-49 which requires a foreign corporation must reincorporate in Virginia in order to act as a public service corporation. Johnson v. Colonial Pipeline Co., 830 F. Supp. 309 (E.D. Va. 1993).

Subpoena power was not conferred upon the circuit court by the website's act in registering to conduct business in Virginia or designating a registered agent for service of process in the Commonwealth.

        - Where only activity of soliciting agents of defendant corporation other than soliciting orders was assisting the customers in the use of advertising media and the display of products and the payment of "push money," this was not enough to meet the "solicitation plus" test indicated in International Harvester Co. of Am. v. Kentucky, 234 U.S. 579, 34 S. Ct. 944, 58 L. Ed. 1479 (1914); Sikes v. Rexall Drug Co., 176 F. Supp. 33 (W.D. Va. 1959).

         Doing of business by subsidiary does not confer jurisdiction over parent.

         And service on parent does not confer jurisdiction over subsidiary.

        - If plaintiff's injury does not arise out of something done in the forum state, then other contacts between the corporation and the state must be fairly extensive before the burden of defending a suit there may be imposed upon it without offending traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Goldrick v. D.M. Picton Co., 56 F.R.D. 639 (E.D. Va. 1971).

         Curtailment of activity in or withdrawal from State.

        - Curtailment of activity does not defeat the power of the state when service is effected upon some active agent, or there is substituted service. Westcott-Alexander, Inc. v. Dailey, 264 F.2d 853 (4th Cir. 1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        A reduction of activity in Virginia, or a partial withdrawal from it, after a cause of action has arisen, does not defeat the jurisdictional power of the state. Westcott-Alexander, Inc. v. Dailey, 264 F.2d 853 (4th Cir. 1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court of Virginia has construed the statutes as authorizing process against a foreign corporation completely withdrawn from the state at the time of service, if the cause of action arose in Virginia out of business previously conducted by the withdrawn corporation in Virginia. Eure v. Morgan Jones &amp; Co., <cite class="va_code">195 Va. 678</cite>, 79 S.E.2d 862 (1954). Such an application of the statute encounters no constitutional objection, certainly when there remains residual activity in Virginia. Westcott-Alexander, Inc. v.

     The provisions of this section do not materially differ from the rules of the common law
    </b>
    with respect to the rights of a stockholder to inspect the books and records of a corporation. At common law a stockholder is entitled to inspect corporate books and records at a proper time and place and for a proper purpose. This right is not absolute and uncontrolled but must be exercised in good faith and for some reasonable purpose germane to his interest as a stockholder. Bank of Giles County v. Mason, <cite class="va_code">199 Va. 176</cite>, 98 S.E.2d 905 (1956) (decided under prior law).

        <b>
     Mandamus to enforce right of inspection.
    </b>
    - The writ of mandamus is a proper remedy, both under the statute and at common law, available to a stockholder who has been improperly denied his right of inspection, but the petition must state plainly and concisely the grounds of the application. It is fundamental that in order to secure the enforcement of such right, by mandamus or any other remedy, the complainant must satisfy the court that a right of inspection exists in the particular instance. Bank of Giles County v. Mason, <cite class="va_code">199 Va. 176</cite>, 98 S.E.2d 905 (1956) (decided under prior law).

        <b>
     Burden of proof with shareholder.
    </b>
    - A shareholder seeking corporate records pursuant to this section has the burden of satisfying a trial court that he seeks such records for a proper purpose, and that he is acting in good faith to protect his rights as a shareholder and that the relief he seeks will not adversely affect the corporation's interests.

         Virginia International Terminal not alter ego of state.
        </b>
        - While noting that Virginia International Terminal (VIT), has many attributes of a state agency, the court was compelled to place particular significance on the fact that state treasury funds cannot be used to satisfy any judgment against VIT. This factor, combined with VIT's independent corporate existence, compels the conclusion that VIT is not a mere alter ego of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Virginia, by the attorney general's opinion, has expressed the view that VIT is not an agency of the state. Artist v. Virginia Int'l Terms., Inc., 679 F. Supp. 587 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 857 F.2d 977 (4th Cir. 1988).

     Court held without authority to nullify discretion of hospital trustees.

    - Where the trustees of a private hospital corporation, in their sound discretion, excluded a doctor from the use of the facilities of the hospital, the court was without authority to nullify that discretion by injunction process. There were no constitutional or statutory rights of the doctor, or of his patients who might wish to be treated in the hospital by him, which warranted such interference. Khoury v. Community Mem.

        - While noting that Virginia International Terminal (VIT), has many attributes of a state agency, the court was compelled to place particular significance on the fact that state treasury funds cannot be used to satisfy any judgment against VIT. This factor, combined with VIT's independent corporate existence, compels the conclusion that VIT is not a mere alter ego of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Virginia, by the attorney general's opinion, has expressed the view that VIT is not an agency of the state. Artist v.

     Voidable acts.
    </b>
    - A challenge to a voidable corporate act is subject to a defense of the statute of limitations. A contrary conclusion is untenable because it would require the Supreme Court of Virginia to assume, in the absence of any authority, that the Virginia General Assembly intended to render innumerable corporate transactions, imperfectly executed but within a corporation's power to act, subject to attack in perpetuity. In addition, such a conclusion would blur the bright line presently existing between an ultra vires act, in which a corporation lacks power to act, and a voidable act, which is within the lawful scope of a corporation's power.

The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the performance of their duties, and may rely on information provided by such persons and other persons, including those appointed to tabulate votes, unless the inspectors believe reliance is unwarranted.

If the inspectors consider other reliable information for the limited purpose permitted herein, they shall specify, at the time that they make their certification pursuant to clause (v) of subsection B, the precise information that they considered, including the person or persons from whom they obtained the information, when the information was obtained, the means by which the information was obtained, and the basis for their belief that such information is accurate and reliable.

        A conflict of interests transaction is a transaction with the corporation in which a director of the corporation has an interest that precludes him from being a disinterested director. A conflict of interests transaction is not voidable by the corporation solely because of the director's interest in the transaction if any one of the following is true:
        <ol>
         <li id="t13.1c10a08s13.1-871ol1A1">
          The material facts of the transaction and the director's interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors and the board of directors or committee authorized, approved or ratified the transaction;

        For purposes of subdivision A 1, a conflict of interests transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors on the board of directors, or on the committee. A transaction shall not be authorized, approved, or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the disinterested directors vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director who is not disinterested does not affect the validity of any action taken under subdivision A 1 if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or ratified as provided in that subsection.

        For purposes of subdivision A 2, a conflict of interests transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be counted under this subsection. The votes controlled by a director who is not disinterested may not be counted in a vote of members to determine whether to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interests transaction under subdivision A 2. The director's votes, however, may be counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of this Act. A majority of the members, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section.

        - A resident of a continuing care retirement community is not prohibited from serving as a director on its provider's board of directors, as the mere fact that an individual is a resident is no automatic compromise of his good faith judgment and his residency at the facility is not tantamount to a personal interest in a transaction; further, even assuming that the individual did have a personal interest in a transaction before the board, such interest would not necessarily void the transaction so long as the material facts of his interest were known or disclosed.

    - The legislature clearly acts for the public good, in the proper exercise of its police power, when it provides that corporate assets which find their origin in public tax funds and voluntary civic contributions shall, when the corporation is dissolved, be distributed so as to insure their continued use for public and civic purposes. In so acting, the legislature may properly provide that its regulations shall be as binding upon corporate charters previously granted as upon those to be granted in the future. Hanshaw v. Day, <cite class="va_code">202 Va. 818</cite>, 120 S.E.2d 460 (1961) (decided under prior law).

        §

        - Operating agreement showed the parties' intent to operate a business together as a limited liability company or a business as a partnership up to the time the limited liability company came into being; thus, when the investor wrote checks, the funds became the property of the business entity. A cause of action for conversion would require that the entity in place that received the funds be named, and a recovery by that entity, the limited liability company, by way of a derivative claim, would then be distributable to the members according to their interests; therefore, the investor had no standing to sue for conversion under
        §
        13.1-1007 because the funds alleged to have been converted belonged to the business entity after the investor wrote four checks payable to the entity, which was operating either as a partnership or a limited liability company.

         Representative of limited liability company was not an applicant for insurance.

        - Insurance company wrongfully rescinded a limited liability company's insurance policy due to material misrepresentation after learning the representative who signed the policy on behalf of the LLC had a criminal record for insurance fraud, because the term "applicant" refers only to the party seeking to purchase insurance. There was nothing in the record to suggest that the applicant was acting individually when he completed and signed the application on behalf of the LLC; the policy covered property owned by the LLC.

         Manager's personal liability.

        - Manager of a limited liability company subcontractor was not personally liable on a contract with a general contractor that incorrectly identified the limited liability company as a corporation because (1) the general contractor clearly thought the subcontractor was a corporation, not an individual, (2) the manager's signature did not bind the limited liability company, as nothing showed the corporation listed existed, and the manager's failure to identify the limited liability company on the contract did not create personal liability, as all parties clearly considered the signature to be a corporate act, (3) the contract did not provide for any party's personal liability, and (4) using "Inc." on the contract was a misnomer that did not affect the parties' intent.

        - Articles of Organization of plaintiff limited liability company did not list any managers for the limited liability company and the limited liability company did not have an operating agreement, but since Virginia law dictated that the management of a limited liability company without an operating agreement vested in its members, one or more members of the limited liability company had to exist. The court turned to extrinsic evidence to determine the membership of the company, concluding that defendant debtor was one of two initial members because defendant was listed as an organizer, he signed numerous documents binding the company, he incurred significant expenses on the company's behalf, he filed tax returns for the company, and he held himself out as president.

         Fiduciary duties.
        </b>
        - Although a state court determined that a debtor breached his fiduciary duty, it was not clear to a bankruptcy court, in the context of a dischargeability complaint under 11 U.S.C.S.
        §
        523(a)(4), in what capacity the debtor stood to a limited liability company (LLC), i.e., whether he was a managing member or a member of a member-managed LLC (subsection A of
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        13.1-1022); what management duties, if any, he had (subsection A of

         §
        </span>
        13.1-1024.1); whether he was winding up the LLC; or whether the remaining members intended to continue in the business after his withdrawal. Thus, summary judgment on the issue of the nondischargeability of debts incurred as a result of defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity was denied, as the court could not determine whether or not he had fiduciary duties to the LLC and, under Virginia law, determined that he had no fiduciary duties to the other members.

        Regarding a former member's claims against a limited liability company (LLC), equitable subordination was not warranted, because the LLC did not demonstrate a sufficient factual basis for the court to find inequitable conduct or harm since, inter alia, the LLC did not prove violation of a fiduciary duty based on self-dealing or inaction.

        §
        523(a)(4), in what capacity the debtor stood to a limited liability company (LLC), i.e., whether he was a managing member or a member of a member-managed LLC (subsection A of

Thus, summary judgment on the issue of the nondischargeability of debts incurred as a result of defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity was denied, as the court could not determine whether or not he had fiduciary duties to the LLC and, under Virginia law, determined that he had no fiduciary duties to the other members.

    - When a limited liability company (LLC) directly sued another LLC of which the first LLC was a member, as well as the second LLC's manager, rather than derivatively, for breach of fiduciary duty, there was no meaningful distinction between whether the manager was a member-manager or a manager-manager, because the provision in

     Member's standing to sue manager directly for breach of fiduciary duty.
    </b>
    - Limited liability company had no standing to directly sue another LLC of which the first LLC was a member, as well as the second LLC's manager, rather than derivatively, for breach of fiduciary duty, because, while the manager had a responsibility to discharge the manager's duties in accordance with the manager's good faith business judgment of the best interests of the LLC, under
    
     §
    
    13.1-1024.1, the general assembly did not choose to impose a fiduciary duty upon the manager of an LLC running directly to the LLC's members, nor did the second LLC's operating agreement directly impose such a duty.

        </b>
        - Although a state court determined that a debtor breached his fiduciary duty, it was not clear to a bankruptcy court, in the context of a dischargeability complaint under 11 U.S.C.S.
        §
        523(a)(4), in what capacity the debtor stood to a limited liability company (LLC), i.e., whether he was a managing member or a member of a member-managed LLC (subsection A of
        <span class="s1">

        </span>
        13.1-1024.1); whether he was winding up the LLC; or whether the remaining members intended to continue in the business after his withdrawal. Thus, summary judgment on the issue of the nondischargeability of debts incurred as a result of defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity was denied, as the court could not determine whether or not he had fiduciary duties to the LLC and, under Virginia law, determined that he had no fiduciary duties to the other members.

        Member did not lack standing to bring his lawsuit against the manager of the limited liability company; although it was true, as the manager and limited liability company claimed that the member had not made payments on the promissory note that he signed as his capital contribution, the manager waived any obligation on the member's part to make those payments because the manager told him that the limited liability company would "take care of" the promissory note payments, which prompted the member to not make such payments; accordingly the membership of the member had not been terminated and he had standing to pursue his action against the manager.

An assignment of an interest in a limited liability company does not of itself dissolve the limited liability company.

     Member cannot unilaterally alienate personal control interest.

    - It is not possible for a member unilaterally to alienate his or her personal control interest in a limited liability company because the words "unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement" in Virginia Limited Liability Company Act,
    
     §
    
    13.1-1039, make it possible for a limited liability company to restrict the assignment of members' financial interests since they modify the remainder of the sentence, which continues a membership in a limited liability company is assignable in whole or in part; the words "unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement" do not make it possible for a limited liability company to allow a member to assign his or her control interest because they do not modify the separate sentence, which states that an assignment does not entitle the assignee to participate in the management and affairs of the limited liability company or to become or to exercise any rights of a member.

         Assignment found.
        </b>
        - In the absence of an operating agreement for plaintiff limited liability company or an explicit limitation on assignment in the articles of organization, the court found that one of the initial members of the limited liability company assigned his membership interest in the company, pursuant to subsection A of
        §
        13.1-1039, to plaintiff claimant at some point in order to secure plaintiff's financial commitment to the company. Such an assignment was consistent with the representations the individual made to plaintiff about her membership in the company that prompted her to expend significant sums to fund the company's activities, and such an assignment was not inconsistent with the individual's later repudiation of his membership interest in the company.

         Recommendation of dissociation supported.
        </b>
        - Commissioner's factual determinations supported the recommendation that a manager of a limited liability company (LLC) be dissociated from the LLC because there was the concern that one member would try to oppress the manager after prevailing in the instant protracted and bitter suit; there was nothing in the statutes or the operating agreement authorizing the court to impose a lesser sanction.

        13.1-1040.1(5)(a), (b), (c), 13.1-1042, and 13.1-1044, the co-principal was dissociated. Schrager v. Isquith,, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 124 (Richmond County July 18, 2006).

        §
        13.2-1040.1. Moreover, reasonable people could have drawn different conclusions from the interpretation of the LLC's operating agreement.

        - Where plaintiff Virginia company sought to prevent arbitration of a dispute over the rights to proceeds of a patent infringement case, and defendant, a Columbian company, asserted counterclaims, arguing that it was a member in a limited liability company (LLC) formed with the Virginia company, to which the Virginia company had allegedly licensed the patent, the Columbian company was not asserting the rights of the LLC derivatively and had no standing; even though the Columbian company could in certain circumstances have asserted the LLC's claim against the Virginia company on the LLC's behalf derivatively, the Columbian company had not done that in its counterclaims.

     Judicial dissolution.
    </b>
    - Trial court properly ruled that the other company owner could be expelled from the limited liability company in which he was part owner, as the evidence showed that he engaged in wrongful conduct that adversely and materially affected the business of the limited liability company; however, the trial court erred in also ordering that the limited liability company be dissolved as the record did not show that it was not reasonably practicable to carry on the business of the limited liability company.

        - Distributions from the limited liability company were to go equally to the members, who were brother and sister; all distributions went 100 percent to the sister, and the brother had a limited personal cause of action against his sister and after her death against her estate.

       <p>
        Two-year limitation barred the limited liability company (LLC) from suing the sister as a member who received a wrongful distribution, but this was an action by the brother on his creditor's claim against his sister, which did not arise until she was conveyed an interest in the property in the liquidation of the assets of the dissolved LLC, and thus the two-year limitation did not operate as a bar against the brother's claim.

        - Trust did not meet the statutory requirements for a "business trust" under the Virginia Business Trust Act (VBTA),
        §
        13.1-1200 et seq., where, first, the trust property was not "managed, administered, controlled, invested, reinvested or operated" by the trustee; second, the trustee never filed articles of trust under the VBTA for the trust. Additionally, the trust documents and totality of the circumstances supported the conclusion that the trust was not a business trust. Williams v. Equity Holding Corp., 498 F.
