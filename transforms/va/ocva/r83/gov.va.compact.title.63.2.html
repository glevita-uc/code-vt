        - The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children is intended only to govern the placing of children in substitute arrangements for parental care, such as foster care or adoption, the Compact does not apply when a child is returned to a natural parent residing in another state.

         Jurisdiction.
        </b>
        - When an agency from another state places a child in Georgia pursuant to the ICPC, the agency that sent the child to Georgia shall retain jurisdiction over the child sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody, supervision, care, treatment and disposition of the child; the parents' filing of a habeas corpus action in Georgia does not change the result. Such action was not authorized under the ICPC, as the parents could not force Georgia to divest the South Carolina Department of Social Services of its jurisdiction. In the Interest of K.W., 261 Ga. App. 654, 583 S.E.2d 509, 2003 Ga. App. LEXIS 739 (2003).

         Placement outside the jurisdiction.
        </b>
        - Where a child was placed with his aunt in New Hampshire after the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services recommended such placement, but the child was later returned to Florida after New Hampshire rescinded its placement approval, the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children applied, and a trial court erred in returning the child to the aunt without reapplication of Art. III(d) and receipt of a second placement approval from New Hampshire. Dep't of Children & Families v. Fellows, 30 Fla. L. Weekly D 496, 895 So. 2d 1181, 2005 Fla. App. LEXIS 1672 (Fla. Dist. Ct.

         Compliance with prior court orders.
        </b>
        - Nowhere does the ICPC purport to allow the ICPC compact administrator in either the "sending state" or the "receiving state" to ignore or contradict preexisting court orders concerning the custody and placement of children. In this case, the Hawaii court determined the appropriate placement for the two children and regardless of whether the Florida or Hawaii ICPC administrators agreed with the Hawaii court's placement decision, they were required to obey that court order, and the Florida court was required to enforce it. Dep't of Children & Family Servs. v. D.N. (In re D.N.), 28 Fla. L. Weekly D 2278, 858 So. 2d 1087, 2003 Fl. App. LEXIS 14777 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2d Dist. 2003), reh'g denied, 2003 Fla.

        <b>
         Requirements.
        </b>
        - Since the ICPC requires compliance with the laws of the sending state and Indiana's laws required that the state either 1) obtain the consent of both birth parents in an interstate adoption proceeding, 2) get a court order finding consent of one or both parents is not necessary, or 3) prove publication to a missing parent, then the putative father is entitled to a hearing where none of those requirements were met. In re Adoption of Lichtenburg, 2003 Ohio 1014, 2003 Ohio App. LEXIS 968 (Ct. App., Warren County 2003).
       </p>
       <p class="p9">
        Under the ICPC, a child shall not be sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state notify the sending agency, in writing, that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of the child. In re L.L., 172 N.C. App. 689, 616 S.E.2d 392, 2005 N.C. App. LEXIS 1798 (N.C. Ct. App. 2005).

         Authority to grant consent to adoption.

        - The court held that the Oklahoma Dept. of Human Services (DHS) has the authority to grant consent to an adoption and thus, impliedly, the DHS has the authority to withhold consent to an adoption.

        - Adoption agencies had standing to bring an action to determine whether the Interstate Compact on Placement of Children applies to the unborn children of expectant mothers who come to Utah to give birth and place the children for adoption. The agencies had a legally enforceable interest in their licenses, which could be suspended or revoked for noncompliance with the compact. Alternative Options & Servs. for Children v.
