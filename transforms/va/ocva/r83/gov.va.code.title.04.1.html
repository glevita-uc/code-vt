          - Evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was intoxicated where he stopped his vehicle in the travel lane of a public road in the middle of the night and got out to clean it; staggered as he walked; had an odor of alcohol about him; slurred his speech; failed a sobriety test; and admitted earlier alcohol consumption.

          To be intoxicated the person must have drunk a sufficient amount of alcoholic beverages so as to affect him. Clemmer v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">208 Va. 661</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 664 (1968).

     The issue of intoxication is properly admitted
    </b>
    when there are circumstances present other than the mere odor of alcohol on one's breath, such as evidence showing that the person's "manner, disposition, speech, muscular movement, general appearance or behavior" is affected. Hemming v. Hutchinson, <cite class="va_code">221 Va. 1143</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 230 (1981).

          <b>
     Odor of alcohol on one's breath.
    </b>
    - The mere odor of alcohol on one's breath presents no question of intoxication for the determination of the jury. Hill v. Lee, <cite class="va_code">209 Va. 569</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 274 (1969).
         </p>
         <p>
          But the odor of alcohol on a person's breath coupled with other circumstances, such as those indicated in the definition of "intoxicated", will be sufficient to support a finding of intoxication. Hill v. Lee, <cite class="va_code">209 Va. 569</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 274 (1969); United States v. Gholson, 319 F. Supp. 499 (E.D. Va. 1970).
         </p>
         <p>
          The mere odor of alcohol on a person's breath is insufficient to prove intoxication. Hemming v. Hutchinson, <cite class="va_code">221 Va. 1143</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 230 (1981).
         </p>
         <p>
          Court decisions establish the rule that the mere odor of alcohol on a person's breath is insufficient to establish either his intoxication, or his lack of control. But this rule does not apply, for example, where evidence shows that the consumption of alcohol has affected the person's "manner, disposition, speech, muscular movement, general appearance or behavior." These factors are listed in a statutory definition of intoxication contained in this section and applied in some of the decisions. Baker v.

          - Since the blood test has been adopted as a definition of the crime of driving while intoxicated where the blood test is consented to and given, the definition of "intoxicated", which has been used by the courts of Virginia in defining intoxication where no blood test is given, should also be adopted under the Assimilative Crimes Act as a definition of the offense where there is no test.

The exercise of the powers granted by this title shall be in all respects for the benefit of the citizens of the Commonwealth and for the promotion of their safety, health, welfare, and convenience. No part of the assets or net earnings of the Authority shall inure to the benefit of, or be distributable to, any private individual, except that reasonable compensation may be paid for services rendered to or for the Authority affecting one or more of its purposes, and benefits may be conferred that are in conformity with said purposes, and no private individual shall be entitled to share in the distribution of any of the corporate assets on dissolution of the Authority.

          Constitutionality.

         - Virginia's ban on the direct shipment of wine to Virginia consumers from out-of-state entities, not only permits, but encourages, direct shipment to consumers by in-state wineries and farm wineries; Thus, the ban violates the dormant commerce clause and is unconstitutional. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11118 (E.D. Va. 2001), modified and approved, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D.

          No deference to hearing officer's punishment decision.
         </b>
         - This section specifically grants the Board the power to grant, suspend, and revoke licenses. No condition is placed on this power. Therefore, there was no support for argument that the Board owed some degree of deference to the hearing officer's determination of punishment. Paradox Corp. v.

         - Scrutiny of the functions and duties of the members of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission [now Board] and those designated by the Commission [now Board] to conduct hearings leads to the conclusion that the grant of absolute immunity from actions for damages, when they are performing in their adjudicatory capacities, is essential for the conduct of their affairs.

     No authority over land use and zoning.
    </b>
    - Circuit court did not err in its determination that the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board exceeded its authority in granting a farm winery license to a farmer because the ABC Board lacked authority to determine whether a county ordinance was unreasonable; nothing in the statute granted the ABC Board any authority over land use and zoning, and a municipality, not the ABC Board, had authority over zoning.

          "Brand name."
         </b>
         - Title 4.1 does not define "brand name," nor has the Board defined this term in its regulations. In the context of wine labels, Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority appears to be using the term "brand name" synonymously with the term "brand," as that term is defined by the Virginia Code. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Richard L. Saslaw, Member, Senate of Virginia, 18-061, 2019 Va. AG LEXIS 32 (11/15/19).
        </p>
        <p>
         Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority guidance documents should not deem every change on a label to constitute a new brand in a manner that is contrary to the statutory definition of "brand" or that is contrary to regulations promulgated by the ABC Board.

         - Title 4.1 does not define "brand name," nor has the Board defined this term in its regulations.

In the context of wine labels, Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority appears to be using the term "brand name" synonymously with the term "brand," as that term is defined by the Virginia Code. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Richard L. Saslaw, Member, Senate of Virginia, 18-061, 2019 Va. AG LEXIS 32 (11/15/19).
        </p>
        <p>
         Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority guidance documents should not deem every change on a label to constitute a new brand in a manner that is contrary to the statutory definition of "brand" or that is contrary to regulations promulgated by the ABC Board. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Richard L. Saslaw, Member, Senate of Virginia, 18-061, 2019 Va. AG LEXIS 32 (11/15/19).

          Discretion of Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.
         </b>
         - Given that the statutes clearly permitted the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurant's license for failing to meet the required food-beverage ratio, the court of appeals could not ignore the plain statutory language, and it had to affirm the ABC Board's decision to exercise its discretion of issuing a penalty; the plain language of the relevant statutes clearly gave the ABC Board the discretion to impose the penalty.

          Discretion to deviate from guidelines.
         </b>
         - Circuit court properly affirmed the decision of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurant's alcoholic beverage license and to impose a fine because the ABC Board's majority opinion clearly recognized the ABC Board's broad discretion to deviate from its guidelines. Thormac, LLC v. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, 68 Va. App. 216, 807
    S.E.2d 230 (2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court properly affirmed the decision of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurant's alcoholic beverage license and to impose a fine because the ABC Board's imposition of the penalty did not lead to a patently absurd result; the ABC Board's decision was consistent with the plain letter of the law, and the lesser penalty imposed reflected its decision that the restaurant's violation of the food-beverage ratio was a relatively minor one.

          Discretion of Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.
         </b>
         - Given that the statutes clearly permitted the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurant's license for failing to meet the required food-beverage ratio, the court of appeals could not ignore the plain statutory language, and it had to affirm the ABC Board's decision to exercise its discretion of issuing a penalty; the plain language of the relevant statutes clearly gave the ABC Board the discretion to impose the penalty.

          Discretion to deviate from guidelines.
         </b>
         - Circuit court properly affirmed the decision of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurant's alcoholic beverage license and to impose a fine because the ABC Board's majority opinion clearly recognized the ABC Board's broad discretion to deviate from its guidelines. Thormac, LLC v. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, 68 Va. App. 216, 807
    S.E.2d 230 (2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court properly affirmed the decision of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurant's alcoholic beverage license and to impose a fine because the ABC Board's imposition of the penalty did not lead to a patently absurd result; the ABC Board's decision was consistent with the plain letter of the law, and the lesser penalty imposed reflected its decision that the restaurant's violation of the food-beverage ratio was a relatively minor one. Thormac, LLC v. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, 68 Va. App. 216, 807
    S.E.2d 230 (2017).

          License suspended.
         </b>
         - Circuit court properly upheld the decision of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurant's alcoholic beverage license and to impose a fine for failure to comply because the ABC Board explained its reasoning for deviating from its guidelines, and acting within its discretion, it chose not to apply the substantial compliance doctrine and to impose a penalty, as it was permitted to do by the General Assembly.

          Constitutionality.
         </b>
         - Virginia's ban on the direct shipment of wine to Virginia consumers from out-of-state entities, while Virginia not only permits, but encourages, direct shipment to consumers by in-state wineries and farm wineries, violates the dormant commerce clause and is unconstitutional. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11118 (E.D. Va. 2001), modified and approved, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D. Va. 2002), vacated and remanded sub nom. Bolick v. Danielson, 330 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2003) (and partially rendered moot by 2003 legislation).
        </p>
        <p>
         System whereby Virginia wineries, farm wineries, breweries, and off-premises licensees could directly ship beer and wine to Virginia and out-of-state consumers, where legal, but out-of-state vendors could neither obtain a Virginia license nor directly ship beer or wine to Virginia consumers, was the very definition of a facially discriminatory law; statutes were unconstitutional forms of discrimination in their in-state preferences for Virginia wine and beer. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D. Va. 2002), vacated and remanded sub nom. Bolick v. Danielson, 330 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2003) (and partially rendered moot by 2003 legislation).
        </p>
        <p>
         Fact that Virginia regulated the alcohol market was not sufficient to preclude its status as a market participant because to contravene the dormant Commerce Clause, a state had to do more than regulate markets in which its participation happened to favor local interests; a state acted unconstitutionally when its participation in one market resulted in regulation of another market in which it did not participate, and that could not be said of Virginia's decision to sell only Virginia wines from its own retail stores, as its participation in the wine market had no regulatory effects on other markets.

          Constitutionality.
         </b>
         - Virginia's ban on the direct shipment of wine to Virginia consumers from out-of-state entities, while Virginia not only permits, but encourages, direct shipment to consumers by in-state wineries and farm wineries, violates the dormant commerce clause and is unconstitutional. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11118 (E.D. Va. 2001), modified and approved, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D. Va. 2002), vacated and remanded sub nom. Bolick v. Danielson, 330 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2003) (and partially rendered moot by 2003 legislation).
        </p>
        <p>
         System whereby Virginia wineries, farm wineries, breweries, and off-premises licensees could directly ship beer and wine to Virginia and out-of-state consumers, where legal, but out-of-state vendors could neither obtain a Virginia license nor directly ship beer or wine to Virginia consumers, was the very definition of a facially discriminatory law; statutes were unconstitutional forms of discrimination in their in-state preferences for Virginia wine and beer. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D. Va. 2002), vacated and remanded sub nom. Bolick v. Danielson, 330 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2003) (and partially rendered moot by 2003 legislation).
        </p>
        <p>
         Fact that Virginia regulated the alcohol market was not sufficient to preclude its status as a market participant because to contravene the dormant Commerce Clause, a state had to do more than regulate markets in which its participation happened to favor local interests; a state acted unconstitutionally when its participation in one market resulted in regulation of another market in which it did not participate, and that could not be said of Virginia's decision to sell only Virginia wines from its own retail stores, as its participation in the wine market had no regulatory effects on other markets.

          Constitutionality.
         </b>
         - Virginia's ban on the direct shipment of wine to Virginia consumers from out-of-state entities, while Virginia not only permits, but encourages, direct shipment to consumers by in-state wineries and farm wineries, violates the dormant commerce clause and is unconstitutional. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11118 (E.D. Va. 2001), modified and approved, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D. Va. 2002), vacated and remanded sub nom. Bolick v. Danielson, 330 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2003) (and partially rendered moot by 2003 legislation).
        </p>
        <p>
         System whereby Virginia wineries, farm wineries, breweries, and off-premises licensees could directly ship beer and wine to Virginia and out-of-state consumers, where legal, but out-of-state vendors could neither obtain a Virginia license nor directly ship beer or wine to Virginia consumers, was the very definition of a facially discriminatory law; statutes were unconstitutional forms of discrimination in their in-state preferences for Virginia wine and beer. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D. Va. 2002), vacated and remanded sub nom. Bolick v. Danielson, 330 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2003) (and partially rendered moot by 2003 legislation).
        </p>
        <p>
         Fact that Virginia regulated the alcohol market was not sufficient to preclude its status as a market participant because to contravene the dormant Commerce Clause, a state had to do more than regulate markets in which its participation happened to favor local interests; a state acted unconstitutionally when its participation in one market resulted in regulation of another market in which it did not participate, and that could not be said of Virginia's decision to sell only Virginia wines from its own retail stores, as its participation in the wine market had no regulatory effects on other markets. Brooks v. Vassar, 462 F.3d 341, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 23144 (4th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 550 U.S. 934, 127 S. Ct. 2251, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1090, 2007 U.S. LEXIS 5184 (U.S. 2007).

         <b>
     In deciding whether an act is regulation or taxation, the court looks to
    </b>
    whether the measure raises general revenues or whether it imposes charges that are directly tied to the administration of the particular regulatory scheme that is sought to be imposed. Where the enactment was solely to raise revenues for the city, generally, in the past, such a measure has been considered a tax rather than a regulation. City of Virginia Beach v.

         Grounds for suspension must be charged.
        </b>
        - When the statutory scheme is viewed in its totality, the Commission (now Board) must notify the licensee of a specific reason for a proposed suspension and the evidence produced must substantiate the violation charged. The Commission (now Board) may not, therefore, suspend a license for a violation not charged. Atkinson v. Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control Comm'n, 1 Va.

     Improper transfer of license irrelevant to other civil liability of licensee.

    - The fact that a licensee may have violated that part of the ABC Act which prohibits transfer of a license from one person to another is irrelevant to a determination whether civil liability for damages may properly be assessed against such licensee where tenant's employee assaults a business invitee of tenant, causing personal injuries. Harbour Enters., Inc. v. Ferro, <cite class="va_code">231 Va. 71</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 818 (1986) (decided under prior law).

         Grounds for suspension must be charged.
        </b>
        - When the statutory scheme is viewed in its totality, the Commission (now Board) must notify the licensee of a specific reason for a proposed suspension and the evidence produced must substantiate the violation charged. The Commission (now Board) may not, therefore, suspend a license for a violation not charged. Atkinson v. Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control Comm'n, 1 Va.

     Improper transfer of license irrelevant to other civil liability of licensee.

    - The fact that a licensee may have violated that part of the ABC Act which prohibits transfer of a license from one person to another is irrelevant to a determination whether civil liability for damages may properly be assessed against such licensee where tenant's employee assaults a business invitee of tenant, causing personal injuries. Harbour Enters., Inc. v. Ferro, <cite class="va_code">231 Va. 71</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 818 (1986) (decided under prior law).

    4.1-204</a></cite> does not provide agents of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control with free access, but rather the statute places the burden on both licensees and applicants for a license to provide such access. The statute does not give ABC agents the right to raid with impunity the records and businesses of either applicants or licensees. Osburn v. Va. Dept. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 67 Va. App. 1, 792 S.E.2d 276 (2016), aff'd in part and vacated in part by Osburn v. Va. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, <cite class="va_code">295 Va. 10</cite>, 810 S.E.2d 262

       <p>
        Circuit court did not err in upholding appellant's termination as a special agent with the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control because appellant's search of a license applicant's office violated the Fourth Amendment in contravention of ABC policy. Although the search was initially within the highly regulated industry exception to the warrant requirement, appellant's search of the business office took the search outside the realm of the exception because appellant did not obtain consent from the business owner to enter the office and search business documents.

    4.1-204</a></cite> only provides a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant in the form of the applicant's own consent to the search and provides no other substitute for a warrant aside from the applicant's consent. Therefore, under the statutory scheme, agents of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control must either obtain an inspection warrant or obtain the consent of an applicant or licensee to search the premises. Osburn v. Va. Dept. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 67 Va. App. 1, 792 S.E.2d 276 (2016), aff'd in part and vacated in part by Osburn v. Va. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev.

    (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of a special agent with the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control was appropriate because the agent violated the constitutional rights of an applicant for a retail alcohol license by searching the applicant's business office in back of a restaurant during a site visit without the applicant's knowledge or consent. The exception for warrantless inspections of businesses engaged in highly regulated industries was not applicable because prior to licensure, applicants for licenses were not subject to the warrantless searches. Osburn v. Va. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, <cite class="va_code">295 Va. 10</cite>, 810 S.E.2d 262, 2018 Va. LEXIS 5 (2018).

     Agent's entry onto licensee's property.
    </b>
    - Circuit properly denied an employee's appeal of an order upholding his termination from the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority (ABC) because a special agent's entry into a licensee's property did not fall under the highly regulated industry exception to the Fourth Amendment; the case was dependent upon whether the employee's actions violated ABC policy, which incorporated guidelines about unlawful searches and seizures that were more restrictive than constitutional jurisprudence.

    4.1-204</a></cite> does not provide agents of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control with free access, but rather the statute places the burden on both licensees and applicants for a license to provide such access. The statute does not give ABC agents the right to raid with impunity the records and businesses of either applicants or licensees. Osburn v. Va. Dept. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 67 Va. App. 1, 792 S.E.2d 276 (2016), aff'd in part and vacated in part by Osburn v. Va. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, <cite class="va_code">295 Va. 10</cite>, 810 S.E.2d 262
    (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court did not err in upholding appellant's termination as a special agent with the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control because appellant's search of a license applicant's office violated the Fourth Amendment in contravention of ABC policy. Although the search was initially within the highly regulated industry exception to the warrant requirement, appellant's search of the business office took the search outside the realm of the exception because appellant did not obtain consent from the business owner to enter the office and search business documents. Osburn v. Va. Dept. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 67 Va. App. 1, 792 S.E.2d 276 (2016), aff'd in part and vacated in part by Osburn v. Va. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev.

    4.1-204</a></cite> only provides a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant in the form of the applicant's own consent to the search and provides no other substitute for a warrant aside from the applicant's consent. Therefore, under the statutory scheme, agents of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control must either obtain an inspection warrant or obtain the consent of an applicant or licensee to search the premises. Osburn v. Va. Dept. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 67 Va. App. 1, 792 S.E.2d 276 (2016), aff'd in part and vacated in part by Osburn v. Va. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev.

    (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of a special agent with the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control was appropriate because the agent violated the constitutional rights of an applicant for a retail alcohol license by searching the applicant's business office in back of a restaurant during a site visit without the applicant's knowledge or consent. The exception for warrantless inspections of businesses engaged in highly regulated industries was not applicable because prior to licensure, applicants for licenses were not subject to the warrantless searches. Osburn v. Va. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, <cite class="va_code">295 Va. 10</cite>, 810 S.E.2d 262, 2018 Va. LEXIS 5 (2018).

     Agent's entry onto licensee's property.
    </b>
    - Circuit properly denied an employee's appeal of an order upholding his termination from the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority (ABC) because a special agent's entry into a licensee's property did not fall under the highly regulated industry exception to the Fourth Amendment; the case was dependent upon whether the employee's actions violated ABC policy, which incorporated guidelines about unlawful searches and seizures that were more restrictive than constitutional jurisprudence.

    4.1-204</a></cite> does not provide agents of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control with free access, but rather the statute places the burden on both licensees and applicants for a license to provide such access. The statute does not give ABC agents the right to raid with impunity the records and businesses of either applicants or licensees. Osburn v. Va. Dept. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 67 Va. App. 1, 792 S.E.2d 276 (2016), aff'd in part and vacated in part by Osburn v. Va. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, <cite class="va_code">295 Va. 10</cite>, 810 S.E.2d 262

        Circuit court did not err in upholding appellant's termination as a special agent with the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control because appellant's search of a license applicant's office violated the Fourth Amendment in contravention of ABC policy. Although the search was initially within the highly regulated industry exception to the warrant requirement, appellant's search of the business office took the search outside the realm of the exception because appellant did not obtain consent from the business owner to enter the office and search business documents. Osburn v. Va. Dept. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 67 Va. App. 1, 792 S.E.2d 276 (2016), aff'd in part and vacated in part by Osburn v. Va. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev.

    4.1-204</a></cite> only provides a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant in the form of the applicant's own consent to the search and provides no other substitute for a warrant aside from the applicant's consent. Therefore, under the statutory scheme, agents of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control must either obtain an inspection warrant or obtain the consent of an applicant or licensee to search the premises. Osburn v. Va. Dept. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 67 Va. App. 1, 792 S.E.2d 276 (2016), aff'd in part and vacated in part by Osburn v. Va. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev.

        Termination of a special agent with the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control was appropriate because the agent violated the constitutional rights of an applicant for a retail alcohol license by searching the applicant's business office in back of a restaurant during a site visit without the applicant's knowledge or consent. The exception for warrantless inspections of businesses engaged in highly regulated industries was not applicable because prior to licensure, applicants for licenses were not subject to the warrantless searches. Osburn v. Va. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, <cite class="va_code">295 Va. 10</cite>, 810 S.E.2d 262, 2018 Va. LEXIS 5 (2018).

     Agent's entry onto licensee's property.

    - Circuit properly denied an employee's appeal of an order upholding his termination from the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority (ABC) because a special agent's entry into a licensee's property did not fall under the highly regulated industry exception to the Fourth Amendment; the case was dependent upon whether the employee's actions violated ABC policy, which incorporated guidelines about unlawful searches and seizures that were more restrictive than constitutional jurisprudence.

         License suspended.
        </b>
        - Circuit court properly upheld the decision of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurant's alcoholic beverage license and to impose a fine for failure to comply with the statute because the ABC Board explained its reasoning for deviating from its guidelines, and acting within its discretion, it chose not to apply the substantial compliance doctrine and to impose a penalty, as it was permitted to do by the General Assembly. Thormac, LLC v. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, 68 Va. App. 216, 807
    S.E.2d 230 (2017) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that the statutes clearly permitted the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurant's license for failing to meet the required food-beverage ratio, the court of appeals could not ignore the plain statutory language, and it had to affirm the ABC Board's decision to exercise its discretion of issuing a penalty; the plain language of the relevant statutes clearly gave the ABC Board the discretion to impose the penalty. Thormac, LLC v. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, 68 Va. App. 216, 807
    S.E.2d 230 (2017) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court properly affirmed the decision of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurant's alcoholic beverage license and to impose a fine because the ABC Board's imposition of the penalty did not lead to a patently absurd result; the ABC Board's decision was consistent with the plain letter of the law, and the lesser penalty imposed reflected its decision that the restaurant's violation of the food-beverage ratio was a relatively minor one.

        - Virginia's ban on the direct shipment of wine to Virginia consumers from out-of-state entities, while Virginia not only permits, but encourages, direct shipment to consumers by in-state wineries and farm wineries, violates the dormant commerce clause and is unconstitutional. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11118 (E.D. Va. 2001), modified and approved, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D.

       <p>
        System whereby Virginia wineries, farm wineries, breweries, and off-premises licensees could directly ship beer and wine to Virginia and out-of-state consumers, where legal, but out-of-state vendors could neither obtain a Virginia license nor directly ship beer or wine to Virginia consumers, was the very definition of a facially discriminatory law; statutes were unconstitutional forms of discrimination in their in-state preferences for Virginia wine and beer. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D. Va. 2002), vacated and remanded sub nom. Bolick v.

        - Virginia's ban on the direct shipment of wine to Virginia consumers from out-of-state entities, while Virginia not only permits, but encourages, direct shipment to consumers by in-state wineries and farm wineries, violates the dormant commerce clause and is unconstitutional. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11118 (E.D. Va. 2001), modified and approved, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D.

       <p>
        This section, which provides that out-of-state beer may not be shipped into Virginia other than to a Virginia licensee and that no out-of-state producer may be granted a license, violates the dormant commerce clause and is unconstitutional. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11118 (E.D. Va. 2001), modified and approved, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D.

       <p>
        System whereby Virginia wineries, farm wineries, breweries, and off-premises licensees could directly ship beer and wine to Virginia and out-of-state consumers, where legal, but out-of-state vendors could neither obtain a Virginia license nor directly ship beer or wine to Virginia consumers, was the very definition of a facially discriminatory law; statutes were unconstitutional forms of discrimination in their in-state preferences for Virginia wine and beer. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D. Va. 2002), vacated and remanded sub nom. Bolick v.

        - Virginia's ban on the direct shipment of wine to Virginia consumers from out-of-state entities, while Virginia not only permits, but encourages, direct shipment to consumers by in-state wineries and farm wineries, violates the dormant commerce clause and is unconstitutional. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11118 (E.D. Va. 2001), modified and approved, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D. Va. 2002), vacated and remanded sub nom. Bolick v. Danielson, 330 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2003) (and partially rendered moot by 2003 legislation).

       <p>
        System whereby Virginia wineries, farm wineries, breweries, and off-premises licensees could directly ship beer and wine to Virginia and out-of-state consumers, where legal, but out-of-state vendors could neither obtain a Virginia license nor directly ship beer or wine to Virginia consumers, was the very definition of a facially discriminatory law; statutes were unconstitutional forms of discrimination in their in-state preferences for Virginia wine and beer. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D. Va. 2002), vacated and remanded sub nom. Bolick v.

        - Virginia's ban on the direct shipment of wine to Virginia consumers from out-of-state entities, while Virginia not only permits, but encourages, direct shipment to consumers by in-state wineries and farm wineries, violates the dormant commerce clause and is unconstitutional. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11118 (E.D. Va. 2001), modified and approved, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D.

       <p>
        System whereby Virginia wineries, farm wineries, breweries, and off-premises licensees could directly ship beer and wine to Virginia and out-of-state consumers, where legal, but out-of-state vendors could neither obtain a Virginia license nor directly ship beer or wine to Virginia consumers, was the very definition of a facially discriminatory law; statutes were unconstitutional forms of discrimination in their in-state preferences for Virginia wine and beer. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D. Va. 2002), vacated and remanded sub nom. Bolick v.

         License suspended.
        </b>
        - Circuit court properly upheld the decision of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurant's alcoholic beverage license and to impose a fine for failure to comply with the statute because the ABC Board explained its reasoning for deviating from its guidelines, and acting within its discretion, it chose not to apply the substantial compliance doctrine and to impose a penalty, as it was permitted to do by the General Assembly. Thormac, LLC v. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, 68 Va. App. 216, 807
    S.E.2d 230 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that the statutes clearly permitted the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurant's license for failing to meet the required food-beverage ratio, the court of appeals could not ignore the plain statutory language, and it had to affirm the ABC Board's decision to exercise its discretion of issuing a penalty; the plain language of the relevant statutes clearly gave the ABC Board the discretion to impose the penalty. Thormac, LLC v. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, 68 Va. App. 216, 807
    S.E.2d 230 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court properly affirmed the decision of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to suspend a restaurant's alcoholic beverage license and to impose a fine because the ABC Board's imposition of the penalty did not lead to a patently absurd result; the ABC Board's decision was consistent with the plain letter of the law, and the lesser penalty imposed reflected its decision that the restaurant's violation of the food-beverage ratio was a relatively minor one.

        - Title 4.1 does not define "brand name," nor has the Board defined this term in its regulations. In the context of wine labels, Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority appears to be using the term "brand name" synonymously with the term "brand," as that term is defined by the Virginia Code.

        Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority guidance documents should not deem every change on a label to constitute a new brand in a manner that is contrary to the statutory definition of "brand" or that is contrary to regulations promulgated by the ABC Board.

         Immunity of Board members.
        </b>
        - Scrutiny of the functions and duties of the members of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission (now Board) and those designated by the Commission (now Board) to conduct hearings leads to the conclusion that the grant of absolute immunity from actions for damages, when they are performing in their adjudicatory capacities, is essential for the conduct of their affairs. Hamm v. Yeatts, 479 F. Supp. 267 (W.D. Va. 1979).

        <b>
         Grounds for suspension must be charged.
        </b>
        - When the statutory scheme is viewed in its totality, the Commission (now Board) must notify the licensee of a specific reason for a proposed suspension and the evidence produced must substantiate the violation charged. The Commission (now Board) may not, therefore, suspend a license for a violation not charged. Atkinson v. Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control Comm'n, 1 Va. App. 172, 336 S.E.2d 527 (1985);.

        <b>
         Scope of federal court review.
        </b>
        - Plaintiff's argument that his rights to substantive due process were violated when his application was denied, in that the Commission's (now Board's) conclusions did not conform to and were contrary to the evidence adduced at the hearing, was inappropriate, since it would be improper upon review for the federal court to determine either that the evidence relied upon by the Commission (now Board) was incorrect or that conclusions reached were in error; rather the question for the federal court was whether the denial rested upon substantial evidence. Hamm v. Yeatts, 479 F. Supp. 267 (W.D. Va. 1979).

     Board lacks authority over land use and zoning.
    </b>
    - Circuit court did not err in its determination that the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (ABC Board) exceeded its authority in granting a farm winery license to a farmer because the ABC Board exceeded its authority in determining that a county ordinance was unreasonable; nothing in the statute granted the ABC Board any authority over land use and zoning, and a municipality, not the ABC Board, had authority over zoning.

    - Liquor licensee's constitutional challenge after the suspension of its wine and beer on and off premises and mixed beverage restaurant licenses by the Virginia ABC Board failed; the statute's terms described particularized acts, the occurrence of which, when measured by common practice and understanding, were deemed to violate the statute, and it was sufficiently definite to avoid arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and not unconstitutionally vague.

        - Restricting businessman's liquor license against the chilling of alcoholic beverages for off premises consumption was both reasonable and justified where substantial evidence was presented which, if known, would have entitled the ABC Board to refuse to grant businessman's liquor license at the outset where the record established that the corner serves as a club on the street for groups of people who congregated and loitered outside the licensed establishments which gave reasonable cause to believe that the disproportionate number of alcohol related offenses occurring in the vicinity of the corner stemmed from the easy access to chilled alcoholic beverages which were procured from the licensed establishments and immediately consumed and where the testimony of numerous area residents, including the school principal, further demonstrated that the neighborhood and its institutions were adversely affected by these alcohol related abuses.

    - An officer of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission (now Board) who ascertains that a person is equipped to make illegal sales of whiskey and buys whiskey from that person is a "feigned accomplice," who, when he acts strictly within the scope of his employment, is not an accomplice in the sense that his uncorroborated testimony will not support a conviction, nor in the sense that his testimony should be condemned as unworthy of belief by the trial judge by an instruction that the jury must act upon it with caution.

     And testimony of such officer as to purchase was admissible.

    - In a prosecution under the former Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, the only evidence for the Commonwealth consisted in the testimony of an inspector of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission (now Board), who testified that he bought whiskey from accused and introduced a bottle of whiskey which he asserted he had purchased from accused. It was held that the evidence of the officer was admissible and, if believed by the jury, was sufficient to sustain a conviction. Guthrie v.

    4-62</a></cite> (see now subsection B of this section) did not make the status of alcoholism a criminal offense, but merely makes specific behavior, e.g. the purchase of alcoholic beverages by one who is interdicted, unlawful. This law in no way violates the Eighth Amendment when it is made applicable to an alcoholic. Fisher v. Coleman, 486 F. Supp. 311 (W.D. Va. 1979), aff'd, 639 F.2d 191 (4th Cir. 1981), overruled by Manning v. Caldwell, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Equal protection challenge to interdiction statutes failed, as the Commonwealth had a legitimate interest in discouraging alcohol and drug abuse, and it could not be said that preventing the possession or consumption of alcohol by individuals that admittedly could not mitigate their alcohol consumption or who had been adjudged to be at risk of abusing alcohol through interdiction proceedings, was not rationally related to this legitimate interest. Hendrick v. Caldwell, 232 F. Supp. 3d 868, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17563 (W.D. Va. 2017), aff'd by Manning v. Caldwell, 900 F.3d 139 (4th Cir. 2018), on reh'g, rev'd, remanded, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vagueness challenge to interdiction statute failed because the statute contained explicit standards that law enforcement had to apply to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and put plaintiffs on reasonable notice as to the proscribed conduct. Hendrick v. Caldwell, 232 F. Supp. 3d 868, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17563 (W.D. Va. 2017), aff'd by Manning v. Caldwell, 900 F.3d 139 (4th Cir. 2018), on reh'g, rev'd, remanded, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Consumption prongs of interdiction statutes did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. VIII, as they did not punish the status of being a homeless alcoholic but rather punished the act of possessing or consuming alcohol, regardless of whether that possession or consumption was in public. Hendrick v. Caldwell, 232 F. Supp. 3d 868, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17563 (W.D. Va. 2017), aff'd by Manning v. Caldwell, 900 F.3d 139 (4th Cir. 2018), on reh'g, rev'd, remanded, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in dismissing action brought by plaintiff homeless alcoholics challenging Virginia statutory scheme that made it criminal offense for those whom Commonwealth had labelled habitual drunkards to possess, consume, or purchase alcohol because challenged scheme's use of term "habitual drunkard" was unconstitutionally vague, and even if it could be narrowed to apply only to similarly situated alcoholics, plaintiffs stated claim that it violated Eighth Amendment as applied to them; decision in
        Fisher v. Coleman
        , 639 F.2d 191 (4th Cir. 1981) affirming constitutionality of Virginia scheme was expressly overruled. Manning v. Caldwell, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019).

     Motion to suppress properly denied.
    </b>
    - Once an officer observed the seemingly underage individuals holding beer bottles and then fleeing from the police presence, he had probable cause to believe that a crime was being committed. Because the development of probable cause and the creation of the exigencies were virtually contemporaneous, the officer had no meaningful opportunity in which to obtain a search warrant for the property before exigent circumstances necessitated his further intrusion onto the premises; thus, the trial court did not err in concluding that the officer had both probable cause and exigent circumstances sufficient to justify his warrantless entry into defendant's backyard, the denial of his motion to suppress was affirmed, and his convictions for contributing to the delinquency of a minor were affirmed.

        - Virginia's ban on the direct shipment of wine to Virginia consumers from out-of-state entities, while Virginia not only permits, but encourages, direct shipment to consumers by in-state wineries and farm wineries, violates the dormant commerce clause and is unconstitutional. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11118 (E.D. Va. 2001), modified and approved, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D.

       <p>
        System whereby Virginia wineries, farm wineries, breweries, and off-premises licensees could directly ship beer and wine to Virginia and out-of-state consumers, where legal, but out-of-state vendors could neither obtain a Virginia license nor directly ship beer or wine to Virginia consumers, was the very definition of a facially discriminatory law; statutes were unconstitutional forms of discrimination in their in-state preferences for Virginia wine and beer. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D. Va. 2002), vacated and remanded sub nom. Bolick v.

    4.1-100</a></cite> et seq., is not economic protectionism but part of Virginia's import regulation, as it provides a de minimis exception to Virginia's import regulations, allowing consumers to import one gallon or four liters of wine for personal consumption (under no economic construct could such a provision be considered economic protectionism of local industry because it actually amounts to a disadvantage to local wineries whose wine may only be purchased through retailers); accordingly, the Personal Import Exception does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.

         Constitutionality.
        </b>
        - Virginia's ban on the direct shipment of wine to Virginia consumers from out-of-state entities, while Virginia not only permits, but encourages, direct shipment to consumers by in-state wineries and farm wineries, violates the dormant commerce clause and is unconstitutional. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11118 (E.D. Va. 2001), modified and approved, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D. Va. 2002), vacated and remanded sub nom. Bolick v. Danielson, 330 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2003) (and partially rendered moot by 2003 legislation).
       </p>
       <p>
        System whereby Virginia wineries, farm wineries, breweries, and off-premises licensees could directly ship beer and wine to Virginia and out-of-state consumers, where legal, but out-of-state vendors could neither obtain a Virginia license nor directly ship beer or wine to Virginia consumers, was the very definition of a facially discriminatory law; statutes were unconstitutional forms of discrimination in their in-state preferences for Virginia wine and beer. Bolick v. Roberts, 199 F. Supp. 2d 397, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6376 (E.D. Va. 2002), vacated and remanded sub nom. Bolick v. Danielson, 330 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2003) (and partially rendered moot by 2003 legislation).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the Twenty-first Amendment grants the states virtually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system, and because the dormant Commerce Clause only prevents a state from enacting regulations that favor in-state producers and thus discriminates against interstate commerce, the Personal Import Exception to Virginia's Alcoholic Beverage Control Act,

    4.1-100</a></cite> et seq., is not economic protectionism but part of Virginia's import regulation, as it provides a de minimis exception to Virginia's import regulations, allowing consumers to import one gallon or four liters of wine for personal consumption (under no economic construct could such a provision be considered economic protectionism of local industry because it actually amounts to a disadvantage to local wineries whose wine may only be purchased through retailers); accordingly, the Personal Import Exception does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.

    - Where stills, still sites, barrels of mash, and apparatuses used in the manufacturing of ardent spirits are found on the premises of the accused, together with some incriminating evidence, they are held sufficient to support a conviction of the accused of the possession of stills and appliances, etc. This is true even though there is evidence contradicting such possession.

    - The evidence for the Commonwealth was that the home of accused was visited at various times by men and women, that some entered the home sober and left it drunk, others were intoxicated when they came and left in an intoxicated condition, and that some left carrying small packages. It was held that this class of evidence was admissible and was a circumstance to be considered, but it was only one of many circumstances to be considered by the jury in determining the guilt of accused.

        The evidence showed that the premises were so conducted that parties entering could first be surveyed by the inmates, a number of bottles of distilled spirits and beer were found on the premises, several of the people in the house were under the influence of liquor, and for some time prior to the search visitors to the house entered sober and came out in such an intoxicated condition that they were arrested for drunkenness. It was held that the evidence was conclusive that accused was the operator of what is commonly termed a "nip joint." Smith v.

    - An indictment which charges unlawful manufacture in one count and the possession of a dangerous weapon while so engaged in another, though loosely drawn, substantially follows the statute. If the second count had not referred to the first, it would probably have been held that it failed to follow the statute, making the gravamen the possession. Edens v.

     Constitutionality.
    </b>
    - This section does not violate the Eighth Amendment by imposing criminal punishment for the status of being an alcoholic nor did it violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by treating homeless alcoholics disparately; further, because defendant failed to present evidence that he was homeless, he lacked standing to challenge the statute based on this classification. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 218, 604 S.E.2d 122, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 514</cite> (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Equal protection challenge to interdiction statutes failed, as the Commonwealth had a legitimate interest in discouraging alcohol and drug abuse, and it could not be said that preventing the possession or consumption of alcohol by individuals that admittedly could not mitigate their alcohol consumption or who had been adjudged to be at risk of abusing alcohol through interdiction proceedings, was not rationally related to this legitimate interest. Hendrick v. Caldwell, 232 F. Supp. 3d 868, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17563 (W.D. Va. 2017), aff'd by Manning v. Caldwell, 900 F.3d 139 (4th Cir. 2018), on reh'g, rev'd, remanded, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vagueness challenge to interdiction statute failed because the statute contained explicit standards that law enforcement had to apply to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and put plaintiffs on reasonable notice as to the proscribed conduct. Hendrick v. Caldwell, 232 F. Supp. 3d 868, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17563 (W.D. Va. 2017), aff'd by Manning v. Caldwell, 900 F.3d 139 (4th Cir. 2018), on reh'g, rev'd, remanded, 930 F.3d 264, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 21084 (4th Cir. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Consumption prongs of interdiction statutes did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. VIII, as they did not punish the status of being a homeless alcoholic but rather punished the act of possessing or consuming alcohol, regardless of whether that possession or consumption was in public. Hendrick v. Caldwell, 232 F. Supp. 3d 868, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17563 (W.D. Va. 2017), aff'd by Manning v.

        While the courts must exercise judgment and discretion in construing any doubtful provisions of the prohibition act, the terms of the statute leave no room to doubt that any willful attempt to violate the law in any substantial particular must be regarded as a crime, and punishable accordingly.

    - Accused drove up to still to get whiskey and was told that none was ready, but that he should wait. While he was waiting the still was raided. It was held that there was not evidence to convict the accused of an attempt to transport, the direct act toward its commission not having been committed. Andrews v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">135 Va. 451</cite>, 115 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 558</cite> (1923). But see Collins v. City of Radford, <cite class="va_code">134 Va. 518</cite>, 113 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 735</cite> (1922).

     Effect where principal guilty of prior offenses.
    </b>
    - While it is true that the general rule is that an accessory is amenable to the same punishment as the principal, this general rule is not applicable to one aiding and abetting a principal who has been guilty of prior offenses. In derogation of the general rule this fixes the status of an aider or abettor and provides that the punishment shall be the same as if the defendant were solely guilty of such violation. Seay v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">155 Va. 1087</cite>, 156 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 574</cite> (1931).

     Accused held not principal or accessory.
    </b>
    - Accused by taking two drinks from a bottle tendered him by a companion in an automobile did not become guilty of the offense of transporting the liquor as a principal in the second degree upon the principle that, being present, he aided and abetted the act. His conduct in drinking from the bottle may have indicated an approval of what they had done and were continuing to do, but it cannot be fairly said to have constituted him a participant in the transportation either as a principal or an accessory.

    - Termination of a special agent with the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control was appropriate because the agent violated the constitutional rights of an applicant for a retail alcohol license by searching the applicant's business office in back of a restaurant during a site visit without the applicant's knowledge or consent. The exception for warrantless inspections of businesses engaged in highly regulated industries was not applicable because prior to licensure, applicants for licenses were not subject to the warrantless searches.

Jackson v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 218, 604 S.E.2d 122, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 514</cite> (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Equal protection challenge to interdiction statutes failed, as the Commonwealth had a legitimate interest in discouraging alcohol and drug abuse, and it could not be said that preventing the possession or consumption of alcohol by individuals that admittedly could not mitigate their alcohol consumption or who had been adjudged to be at risk of abusing alcohol through interdiction proceedings, was not rationally related to this legitimate interest.

       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs failed to state a due process claim because civil interdiction hearings did not deprive them of their physical liberty and, even if it did, the Due Process Clause did not require appointment of counsel at the proceeding. Hendrick v. Caldwell, 232 F. Supp. 3d 868, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17563 (W.D. Va. 2017), aff'd by Manning v.

       <p>
        Although states may not criminalize status, they may criminalize actual behavior even when the individual alleged that addiction created a strong urge to engage in a particular act; a provision that put a person on notice that future acts may result in criminal sanctions did not criminalize status because it did not criminalize anything, and it was the other Virginia provisions, not the statute, that imposed criminal sanctions.

     Manner of introduction.
    </b>
    - In a prosecution for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquors the Commonwealth inadvertently closed its evidence without proving alleged prior conviction of illegal transportation, and counsel for accused moved that the allegation be stricken. The trial court overruled the motion but indicated its readiness to instruct the jury that at that stage of the trial there was no evidence of such prior conviction. After accused had taken the stand and testified in chief, and had been cross-examined, he was asked, over the objection of his counsel, whether he had been previously convicted in the trial justice court of illegal transportation, and he admitted that he had. It was held that the ruling of the trial court was correct in allowing proof of the prior conviction. Smith v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">182 Va. 585</cite>, 30 S.E.2d 26 (1944).

    4.1-317), accused objected to the introduction of evidence of prior convictions of similar offenses and contended that such evidence, if allowed at all, should be limited to the measure of punishment in the event of his conviction of the offense for which he was being tried. It was held that the evidence should be restricted to the quantum of punishment, since the terms of former section did not expressly make such evidence applicable to the case upon trial and it could not be said that its terms impliedly did so.

     Instructions.
    </b>
    - The refusal to instruct the jury "that the fact that the defendant has been heretofore convicted of similar or like offenses is not proof that he is guilty of the offense here charged and such fact should not be considered by the jury in reaching a conclusion as to his guilt or innocence on the present charge," was prejudicial error. Campbell v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">176 Va. 564</cite>, 11 S.E.2d 577 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court should instruct the jury to the effect that evidence of a prior conviction was to be considered only as to the quantum of punishment and was not to be considered as tending to prove the guilt of accused. However, the time of giving instructions rests in the sound judicial discretion of the court, and, in the instant case, there was no abuse of the sound judicial discretion of the trial court in refusing to instruct the jury at the time the evidence was offered.

         "Brand."
        </b>
        - Title 4.1 does not define "brand name," nor has the Board defined this term in its regulations. In the context of wine labels, Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority appears to be using the term "brand name" synonymously with the term "brand," as that term is defined by the Virginia Code. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Richard L. Saslaw, Member, Senate of Virginia, 18-061, 2019 Va. AG LEXIS 32 (11/15/19).
       </p>
       <p>
        Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority guidance documents should not deem every change on a label to constitute a new brand in a manner that is contrary to the statutory definition of "brand" or that is contrary to regulations promulgated by the ABC Board. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Richard L. Saslaw, Member, Senate of Virginia, 18-061, 2019 Va. AG LEXIS 32 (11/15/19).

     Termination of exclusive distributorship agreement justified.
    </b>
    - A winery's termination of an exclusive distributorship contract with a wholesaler was justified by the wholesaler's failure to observe the provisions in the contract requiring it to aggressively promote the winery's products by marketing them to all retail licensees in the state where the wholesaler failed to market the winery's products to large grocery store chains, which were significant portion of the state's retailers.

        Winery violated the Virginia Wine Franchise Act by unilaterally amending its exclusive agreement with the distributor without good cause; the text of the winery's requirements announcement stated that it was a unilateral amendment to the commercial relationship between the parties and "good cause" was not shown, as there was no evidence of any material deficiency for which the distributor was responsible or any other example of "good cause" as enumerated in

        Except as provided in subsection F, a winery shall provide a wholesaler at least ninety days' prior written notice of any intention to amend, terminate, cancel or not renew any agreement. The notice, a copy of which shall be mailed at the same time to the Board, shall state all the reasons for the intended amendment, termination, cancellation or nonrenewal. After providing such notice, a winery may immediately apply to the Board for a determination that it is likely to incur substantial hardship if required to comply with the ninety-day notice requirement. If the Board makes such a determination, the ninety-day notice requirement shall be reduced to thirty days. In this event, the thirty-day notice period shall be included in the sixty-day opportunity to cure period provided in subsection B.

If such condition has been rectified by action of the wholesaler, then the proposed amendment, termination, cancellation or nonrenewal shall be void and without legal effect. However, where the winery contends that action on the part of the wholesaler has not rectified one or more of such conditions, the winery must within fifteen days after the expiration of the sixty-day period request a hearing before the Board to determine if the condition has been rectified by action of the wholesaler.

However, where a petition is made to the Board after the agreement has been terminated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section, the filing of the petition shall not cause the terminated agreement to be reinstated unless the terminated wholesaler's failure to petition in a timely manner was based upon reasonable reliance on representation or other inducements made by the winery.

       There is hereby created in the state treasury a special nonreverting fund to be known as the Virginia Cannabis Equity Business Loan Fund, referred to in this section as "the Fund." The Fund shall be established on the books of the Comptroller. All funds appropriated for such purpose and any gifts, donations, grants, bequests, and other funds received on its behalf shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the Fund. Interest earned on moneys in the Fund shall remain in the Fund and be credited to it. Any moneys remaining in the Fund, including interest thereon, at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. Moneys in the Fund shall be used solely for the purposes of providing low-interest and zero-interest loans to social equity qualified cannabis licensees in order to foster business ownership and economic growth within communities that have been the most disproportionately impacted by the former prohibition of cannabis. Expenditures and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the Comptroller upon written request signed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Authority.
