      Editor's note.
     </b>
     - House Joint Resolution No. 271, approved by the General Assembly in 1987, requested the Virginia Code Commission to undertake a revision of Title 46.1. The Commission's report was published as House Document No. 42 of the 1989 Session and served as the basis for Title 46.2, which was enacted by Acts 1989, c. 727, effective Oct. 1, 1989.
    </p>
    <p class="p6">
     Acts 1989, c. 727, cl. 2, provides that whenever any of the conditions, requirements, provisions, or contents of any section, article, or chapter of Title 46.1 or any other title of this Code as such titles existed prior to Oct. 1, 1989, are transferred in the same or modified form to a new section, article, or chapter of this title or any other title of this Code and whenever any such former section, article, or chapter is given a new number in this or any other title, all references to any such former section, article, or chapter of Title 46.1 or other title appearing in this Code shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section, article, or chapter containing such conditions, requirements, provisions, contents, or portions thereof.
    </p>
    <p class="p6">
     Acts 1989, c. 727, cl. 3, provides that the regulations of the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Department of State Police, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Air Pollution Control, the State Corporation Commission, and any other Department, agency, or instrumentality of the Commonwealth and any ordinance adopted by any political subdivision of the Commonwealth in effect on the effective date of the act (Oct. 1, 1989) shall continue in effect to the extent that they are not in conflict with the act and shall be deemed to be regulations promulgated or ordinances adopted under the act.
    </p>
    <p class="p6">
     Acts 1989, c. 727, cl. 4, provides that the recodification of Title 46.1 as Title 46.2 shall not be construed to require the reappointment of any officer or any member of a board, council, committee, or other appointed body referred to in Title 46.2, and each such officer and member shall continue to serve the term for which appointed pursuant to the provisions of Title 46.1.
    </p>
    <p class="p6">
     Acts 1989, c. 727, cl. 5, provides that the act shall be deemed to have been enacted prior to any other act enacted in the 1989 Regular Session of the General Assembly, and any act purported to amend and reenact any law contained in Title 46.1 or Title 46.2 is deemed to be added to, amendatory of, or a repealer of, as the case may be, any corresponding law contained in the act.
    However, effect shall be given to such other or subsequent act only to the extent of any apparent changes in the law as it existed prior to the commencement of such session.
    </p>
    <p class="p6">
     Many of the cases cited in the notes under provisions of Title 46.2 were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law.

        Federal: The Driver License Compact merely obligates member states to report violations of their traffic laws by out-of-state motorists to the motorists' home states, but does not authorize enforcement of other states' laws; consequently, Kansas law enforcement officer was not authorized to enforce California requirement that vehicles display two license plates when a California motorist, driving a California-registered vehicle, was stopped in Kansas for displaying only one license plate.

        The Compact authorizes member states to issue new licenses to drivers who have had their licenses revoked by other member states if it has been at least one year since revocation; conversely, a member state may not, under the Compact, issue a new driver's license to a driver who has a suspended license in another member state until the suspension period has ended.See also, People v.

        Connecticut: A Connecticut license holder, convicted in Florida for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, was not denied due process when her hearing before the Connecticut commissioner of motor vehicles to determine whether her license should be suspended was limited to the issue of whether she was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in Florida; denying the plaintiff a full hearing to contest the entirety of the out-of-state conviction, including procedural safeguards, the validity of the conviction and the underlying conduct, was not unconstitutional. Kostrzewski v. Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, 52 Conn. App. 326, 727 A.2d 233, appeal denied, 249 Conn. 910, 733 A.2d 227 (1999).

        The suspension of a driver's license, based on an out-of-state criminal prosecution and conviction reported pursuant to the compact, is an administrative sanction that is remedial in nature and advances the interests of public safety; consequently, the suspension is not intended to act solely as a deterrent or retribution, and therefore does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. Kostrzewski v. Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, 52 Conn. App. 326, 727 A.2d 233, appeal denied, 249 Conn. 910, 733 A.2d 227 (1999).

        The proper issuance of a foreign license by a member state under the Driver License Compact terminates an Illinois revocation just as the proper issuance of an Illinois license terminates an Illinois revocation.

        Based on the legislative intent behind the Driver License Compact to discipline Illinois licensed drivers for conduct occurring in another state, an out-of-state conviction for DUI, though based on a plea of

        The Illinois Code provides that, once a driver's license is revoked, the individual is prohibited from driving in Illinois "until a license is obtained when and as permitted under [the Code]"; however, because the Driver License Compact is a part of the Code, the valid issuance of an Indiana license pursuant to the Compact satisfies the Illinois requirement. People v. Klaub, 130 Ill. App. 3d 704, 85 Ill. Dec. 891, 474 N.E.2d 851 (3 Dist. 1985).

        Even though the Driver License Compact requires member states to give the same effect to drunk driving convictions from out-of-state that it would those in-state "for the purposes of suspension, revocation or limitation of the license to operate a motor vehicle," and does not specifically address sentencing, public policy supports the conclusion that the legislature intended an out-of-state drunk driving conviction to be considered a prior offense when sentencing a subsequent in-state offender. State v. Regan, 209 N.J. Super. 596, 508 A.2d 1149, 1986 N.J. Super. LEXIS 1248 (1986).

        Pennsylvania: Court erred in finding that entry of judgment of sentence in a sister state is required for Pennsylvania to deem a licensee 'convicted' for purposes of the Compact without first examining how that sister state defines a conviction. Further, because New York's definition of conviction does not include judgment of sentence and in fact is tantamount to a plea of guilty, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court erred in requiring that judgment of sentence be entered for a valid conviction to have occurred.

        To ignore abstracts from sister states unless they contain a rubber stamp from the out-of-state licensing authority would elevate form over substance; therefore, an Indiana court abstract was allowed as proof of conviction without proof that the abstract came from the licensing authority.

       </p>
       <p class="p6">
        The domicile of the licensee was not determinative of whether or not Pennsylvania was the "home state" under the Compact, rather, "home state" was determined by the operator's license, and the only license held by the licensee was a valid and current Pennsylvania license; Thus, PennDOT had authority under the Compact to suspend the licensee's operating privilege notwithstanding the fact that he was a New Jersey resident at the time of the suspension.

        The Compact requires that the licensing authority forward the conviction report, not that the licensing authority author the report. Where, as here, the documents proffered by the Bureau contain evidence that clearly shows they were transmitted by the licensing authority of the reporting state, such documents should not have been precluded from admission into evidence.

        A photocopy of an electronic conviction report sufficiently showed that the report originated from the convicting state's licensing authority, even though the top of the report was cut off, including the line that indicated the state that issued the report, since its numerous references to New Jersey statutes and conviction locater numbers in addition to the heading, "Division of Motor Vehicles," established that the report was from the New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles.
