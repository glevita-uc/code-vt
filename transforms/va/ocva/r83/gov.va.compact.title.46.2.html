      Editor's note.
     </b>
     - House Joint Resolution No. 271, approved by the General Assembly in 1987, requested the Virginia Code Commission to undertake a revision of Title 46.1. The Commission's report was published as House Document No. 42 of the 1989 Session and served as the basis for Title 46.2, which was enacted by Acts 1989, c. 727, effective Oct. 1, 1989.
    </p>
    <p>
     Acts 1989, c. 727, cl. 2, provides that whenever any of the conditions, requirements, provisions, or contents of any section, article, or chapter of Title 46.1 or any other title of this Code as such titles existed prior to Oct. 1, 1989, are transferred in the same or modified form to a new section, article, or chapter of this title or any other title of this Code and whenever any such former section, article, or chapter is given a new number in this or any other title, all references to any such former section, article, or chapter of Title 46.1 or other title appearing in this Code shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section, article, or chapter containing such conditions, requirements, provisions, contents, or portions thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
     Acts 1989, c. 727, cl. 3, provides that the regulations of the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Department of State Police, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Air Pollution Control, the State Corporation Commission, and any other Department, agency, or instrumentality of the Commonwealth and any ordinance adopted by any political subdivision of the Commonwealth in effect on the effective date of the act (Oct. 1, 1989) shall continue in effect to the extent that they are not in conflict with the act and shall be deemed to be regulations promulgated or ordinances adopted under the act.
    </p>
    <p>
     Acts 1989, c. 727, cl. 4, provides that the recodification of Title 46.1 as Title 46.2 shall not be construed to require the reappointment of any officer or any member of a board, council, committee, or other appointed body referred to in Title 46.2, and each such officer and member shall continue to serve the term for which appointed pursuant to the provisions of Title 46.1.
    </p>
    <p>
     Acts 1989, c. 727, cl. 5, provides that the act shall be deemed to have been enacted prior to any other act enacted in the 1989 Regular Session of the General Assembly, and any act purported to amend and reenact any law contained in Title 46.1 or Title 46.2 is deemed to be added to, amendatory of, or a repealer of, as the case may be, any corresponding law contained in the act.
    However, effect shall be given to such other or subsequent act only to the extent of any apparent changes in the law as it existed prior to the commencement of such session.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many of the cases cited in the notes under provisions of Title 46.2 were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law.

       (2) Make the reciprocal recognition of licenses to drive and eligibility therefor more just and equitable by considering the overall compliance with motor vehicle laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license by reason of which the licensee is authorized or permitted to operate a motor vehicle in any of the party states.

      <p>
       Reports of Conviction
      </p>
      <p>
       The licensing authority of a party state shall report each conviction of a person from another party state occurring within its jurisdiction to the licensing authority of the home state of the licensee.
    Such report shall clearly identify the person convicted; describe the violation specifying the section of the statute, code or ordinance violated; identify the court in which action was taken; indicate whether a plea of guilty or not guilty was entered, or the conviction was a result of the forfeiture of bail, bond or other security; and shall include any special findings made in connection therewith.

       (a) The licensing authority in the home state, for the purposes of suspension, revocation or limitation of the license to operate a motor vehicle, shall give the same effect to the conduct reported, pursuant to Article III of this compact, as it would if such conduct had occurred in the home state, in the case of convictions for:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) Manslaughter or negligent homicide resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle;
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a narcotic drug, or under the influence of any other drug to a degree which renders the driver incapable of safely driving a motor vehicle;

      </p>

      <p>
       (c) If the laws of a party state do not provide for offenses or violations denominated or described in precisely the words employed in subdivision (a) of this article, such party state shall construe the denominations and descriptions appearing in subdivision (a) hereof as being applicable to and identifying those offenses or violations of a substantially similar nature and the laws of such party state shall contain such provisions as may be necessary to ensure that full force and effect is given to this article.

      <p>
       Applications for New Licenses
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon application for a license to drive, the licensing authority in a party state shall ascertain whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of a license to drive issued by any other party state.
    The licensing authority in the state where application is made shall not issue a license to drive to the applicant if:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been suspended by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such suspension period has not terminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been revoked by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such revocation has not terminated, except that after the expiration of one year from the date the license was revoked, such person may make application for a new license if permitted by law.
    The licensing authority may refuse to issue a license to any such applicant if, after investigation, the licensing authority determines that it will not be safe to grant to such person the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) The applicant is the holder of a license to drive issued by another party state and currently in force unless the applicant surrenders such license.

       Article VI
      </p>
      <p>
       Applicability of Other Laws
      </p>
      <p>
       Except as expressly required by provisions of this compact, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the right of any party state to apply any of its other laws relating to licenses to drive to any person or circumstance, nor to invalidate or prevent any driver license agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a nonparty state.

      </p>
      <p>
       (b) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until six months after the executive head of the withdrawing state has given notice of the withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party states.
    No withdrawal shall affect the validity or applicability by the licensing authorities of states remaining party to the compact of any report of conviction occurring prior to the withdrawal.

       This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.
    The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
    If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

     Application for driver's license properly denied.

    - Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) properly refused to issue an applicant a driver's license where his driving privileges remained revoked or suspended in three other states due to his driving while intoxicated (DWI) convictions as

    46.2-316 explicitly prohibited the DMV from issuing a driver's license to any person whose driving privileges were suspended or revoked due to a DWI conviction. Brauer v. DMV, 70 Va. Cir. 145, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 20 (Warren County 2006).

       <p>
        While the Driver License Compact allows a person whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked in another state to apply for a new license in Virginia after expiration of one year from the date of revocation, such permission is circumscribed by the concluding language of the same sentence: "if permitted by law";
        §
        46.2-316 explicitly prohibits the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles from issuing a driver's license to any person whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked by reason of a conviction of driving while under the influence of intoxicants or drugs. Brauer v. DMV, 70 Va. Cir. 145, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 20 (Warren County 2006).

        Federal: The Driver License Compact merely obligates member states to report violations of their traffic laws by out-of-state motorists to the motorists' home states, but does not authorize enforcement of other states' laws; consequently, Kansas law enforcement officer was not authorized to enforce California requirement that vehicles display two license plates when a California motorist, driving a California-registered vehicle, was stopped in Kansas for displaying only one license plate. United States v. Ramstad, 219 F.3d 1263 (10th Cir. Kan. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        By assenting to the Driver License Compact, Congress did not intend to federalize driver's license law, nor did it intend to federalize state actors who give traffic citations. Ambort v. City of Cloverdale,, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3519 (N.D. Cal. 1994).

        Arizona: Driver's license remains valid until the driver is properly notified of revocation and afforded an opportunity for hearing. State v. Johnston, 152 Ariz. 273, 731 P.2d 638 (Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Compact authorizes member states to issue new licenses to drivers who have had their licenses revoked by other member states if it has been at least one year since revocation; conversely, a member state may not, under the Compact, issue a new driver's license to a driver who has a suspended license in another member state until the suspension period has ended.See also, People v. Matsen, 219 Ill. App. 3d 172, 579 N.E.2d 27 (1991); Bray v. Department of Pub. Safety & Corrections, 638 So. 2d 732 (La. App. 1st Cir. 1994); Russell v. Director of Revenue, 861 S.W.2d 223 (Mo. Ct.

        Connecticut: A Connecticut license holder, convicted in Florida for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, was not denied due process when her hearing before the Connecticut commissioner of motor vehicles to determine whether her license should be suspended was limited to the issue of whether she was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in Florida; denying the plaintiff a full hearing to contest the entirety of the out-of-state conviction, including procedural safeguards, the validity of the conviction and the underlying conduct, was not unconstitutional. Kostrzewski v. Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, 52 Conn. App. 326, 727 A.2d 233, appeal denied, 249 Conn. 910, 733 A.2d 227 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The suspension of a driver's license, based on an out-of-state criminal prosecution and conviction reported pursuant to the compact, is an administrative sanction that is remedial in nature and advances the interests of public safety; consequently, the suspension is not intended to act solely as a deterrent or retribution, and therefore does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. Kostrzewski v. Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, 52 Conn. App. 326, 727 A.2d 233, appeal denied, 249 Conn. 910, 733 A.2d 227 (1999).

       <p>
        Idaho: In this case, the licensee was not entitled to a license under the terms of the compact, but was issued one anyway, because the more specific statute addressing the issue controls over the statute that is more general, when the department discovered in 2000 that the license was revoked in 1992, the department was entitled to refuse to renew the license. In re Marshall, 137 Idaho 337, 48 P.3d 666 (Ct. App. 2002).

        Illinois: The phrase "if permitted by law" in the Driver License Compact means that a license may be issued if such an application would be permitted under Illinois law and the Illinois Secretary of State determines that it will be safe to grant such person the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways. Girard v. White, 356 Ill. App. 3d 11, 292 Ill. Dec. 376, 826 N.E.2d 517, 2005 Ill. App. LEXIS 229 (1 Dist. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant, who purposely concealed prior license revocation in order to mislead authorities and prevent them from properly determining whether a new license should be granted, could not use the new, fraudulently obtained license as a defense to the charge of driving while his previous license was revoked. People v. Waldron, 208 Ill. App. 3d 234, 153 Ill. Dec. 126, 566 N.E.2d 976 (4th Dist. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The proper issuance of a foreign license by a member state under the Driver License Compact terminates an Illinois revocation just as the proper issuance of an Illinois license terminates an Illinois revocation. People v. Hutson, 178 Ill. App. 3d 808, 128 Ill. Dec. 40, 533 N.E.2d 1128 (3 Dist.), appeal denied, 126 Ill. 2d 563, 133 Ill. Dec. 673, 541 N.E.2d 1111 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant misplaced his West Virginia driver's license, and subsequently applied for an Illinois license, he was treated as having renounced his right to drive under the West Virginia license just as if he had surrendered it as required by the Driver License Compact, even though he later found the West Virginia license; consequently, the West Virginia license ceased to have legal effect, and defendant's claim that he still possessed a valid driver's license after the Illinois license was revoked had no merit. People v. Romanosky, 160 Ill. App. 3d 120, 111 Ill. Dec. 915, 513 N.E.2d 161 (5 Dist.), appeal denied, 117 Ill. 2d 551, 115 Ill. Dec. 407, 517 N.E.2d 1093 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on the legislative intent behind the Driver License Compact to discipline Illinois licensed drivers for conduct occurring in another state, an out-of-state conviction for DUI, though based on a plea of
        nolo contendere
        , still constitutes a conviction for purposes of the Driver License Compact. Rigney v. Edgar, 135 Ill. App. 3d 893, 90 Ill. Dec. 548, 482 N.E.2d 367 (1 Dist. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Illinois Code provides that, once a driver's license is revoked, the individual is prohibited from driving in Illinois "until a license is obtained when and as permitted under [the Code]"; however, because the Driver License Compact is a part of the Code, the valid issuance of an Indiana license pursuant to the Compact satisfies the Illinois requirement. People v. Klaub, 130 Ill. App. 3d 704, 85 Ill. Dec. 891, 474 N.E.2d 851 (3 Dist. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The valid issuance of a driver's license by a non-compact state does not satisfy the Illinois provision that, once an Illinois driver's license is revoked, an individual is prohibited from driving in Illinois "until a license is obtained when and as permitted under [the Code]"; consequently, a former Illinois resident whose Illinois license had been revoked, who subsequently moved to Texas and obtained a valid license there, could still be convicted for driving in Illinois while his Illinois license was revoked. People v. Jones, 100 Ill. App. 3d 831, 55 Ill. Dec. 840, 426 N.E.2d 1214 (4 Dist. 1981).
        <br/>

       <p>
        Maryland: "If permitted by law," meant that Maryland was free not to allow a person whose Florida license had been revoked in perpetuity to apply for reinstatement after another year had elapsed of that revocation. Gwin v. Motor Vehicle Admin., 385 Md. 440, 869 A.2d 822, 2005 Md. LEXIS 107, cert. denied, 546 U.S. 823, 126 S. Ct. 359, 163 L. Ed. 2d 67 (2005).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        Missouri: Because the driver applied for limited driving privileges in Missouri more than one year after Illinois had revoked his Illinois driver's license, the trial court's granting of the application was permissible under the statute. Mann v. Dir. of Revenue, 140 S.W.3d 106, 2004 Mo. App. LEXIS 698 (Mo. Ct. App. 2004).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        Montana: Because, under the Compact, a conviction in a party state is to be given the same effect as if entered in the home state, a Montana resident and driver's license holder could have a five-year old conviction for DUI in Idaho expunged from his Montana driving record, just as Montana law provides for the expungement of such convictions entered in Montana. State v. Sidmore, 286 Mont. 218, 951 P.2d 558 (1997).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        New Jersey: Under the doctrine of dual sovereignty, the double jeopardy clause does not bar two states from prosecuting a defendant for the same offense when a defendant's single act violates the laws of two sovereigns, the defendant is treated as having committed two distinct offenses. DMV v. Pepe, 379 N.J. Super. 411, 879 A.2d 747 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Holder of New Jersey driver's license, who was convicted of DWI in New York, was still subject to New Jersey license suspension even though New York authorities failed to notify New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles about conviction for over nine months, and even though a one-year suspension of New York driving privileges had already been imposed. Boyd v. DMV, 307 N.J. Super. 356, 704 A.2d 1029, 1998 N.J. Super. LEXIS 17 (App. Div. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The New Jersey Director of Motor Vehicles may suspend a New Jersey license and compel insurance surcharges based on out-of-state motor vehicle violations, regardless of whether or not the license holder is a resident of New Jersey at the time of the offense. In re Johnson, 226 N.J. Super. 1, 543 A.2d 454, 1988 N.J. Super. LEXIS 254 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the Driver License Compact requires member states to give the same effect to drunk driving convictions from out-of-state that it would those in-state "for the purposes of suspension, revocation or limitation of the license to operate a motor vehicle," and does not specifically address sentencing, public policy supports the conclusion that the legislature intended an out-of-state drunk driving conviction to be considered a prior offense when sentencing a subsequent in-state offender. State v. Regan, 209 N.J. Super. 596, 508 A.2d 1149, 1986 N.J. Super. LEXIS 1248 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Director of Motor Vehicles had the power to suspend a New Jersey driver's license based on a conviction for driving while intoxicated in Vermont, even though Vermont was not a signatory to the Driver License Compact. DMV v. Kleinert, 198 N.J. Super. 363, 486 A.2d 1324, 1985 N.J. Super. LEXIS 1152 (1985).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        Oregon: Oregon courts have no authority, under the Driver License Compact, to suspend driving privileges in another state. State v. Scott, 96 Ore. App. 451, 773 P.2d 394, 1989 Ore. App. LEXIS 566 (1989).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        Pennsylvania: Court erred in finding that entry of judgment of sentence in a sister state is required for Pennsylvania to deem a licensee 'convicted' for purposes of the Compact without first examining how that sister state defines a conviction. Further, because New York's definition of conviction does not include judgment of sentence and in fact is tantamount to a plea of guilty, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court erred in requiring that judgment of sentence be entered for a valid conviction to have occurred. Guzan v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 582 Pa. 187, 870 A.2d 810, 2005 Pa. LEXIS 601 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        To ignore abstracts from sister states unless they contain a rubber stamp from the out-of-state licensing authority would elevate form over substance; therefore, an Indiana court abstract was allowed as proof of conviction without proof that the abstract came from the licensing authority. Siekierda v. DOT, 580 Pa. 259, 860 A.2d 76 (Pa. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        The domicile of the licensee was not determinative of whether or not Pennsylvania was the "home state" under the Compact, rather, "home state" was determined by the operator's license, and the only license held by the licensee was a valid and current Pennsylvania license; Thus, PennDOT had authority under the Compact to suspend the licensee's operating privilege notwithstanding the fact that he was a New Jersey resident at the time of the suspension. Litterini v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 2004 Pa. Commw. LEXIS 194, 841 A.2d 152, 2004 Pa. Commw. LEXIS 194 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although documents submitted under the Compact, must contain some indicia that they were sent from the licensing authority, extrinsic evidence may be used to establish the sender of the report. McCord v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 834 A.2d 1257, 2003 Pa. Commw. LEXIS 776 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Compact requires that the licensing authority forward the conviction report, not that the licensing authority author the report. Where, as here, the documents proffered by the Bureau contain evidence that clearly shows they were transmitted by the licensing authority of the reporting state, such documents should not have been precluded from admission into evidence. Kilgore v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 832 A.2d 594, 2003 Pa. Commw. LEXIS 687 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        A photocopy of an electronic conviction report sufficiently showed that the report originated from the convicting state's licensing authority, even though the top of the report was cut off, including the line that indicated the state that issued the report, since its numerous references to New Jersey statutes and conviction locater numbers in addition to the heading, "Division of Motor Vehicles," established that the report was from the New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles. Ferraguti v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 824 A.2d 354, 2003 Pa. Commw. LEXIS 257 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pennsylvania driver claimed that the New Jersey court denied a jury trial or the right to present extrapolation evidence, but the Pennsylvania court held that the Driver's License Compact is a full faith and credit statute, and Pennsylvania will give full faith and credit to convictions in the courts of other states for DUI to a degree, which renders the driver incapable of safe driving. Lees v. Commonwealth, 2003 Pa. Commw. LEXIS 32, 814 A.2d 1289 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Mississippi law, when licensee was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while he had a blood alcohol level of .138%, the Mississippi licensing authority forwarded this information to DOT, which then had a duty, imposed by Article IV of the compact, to "give the same effect to the conduct reported that it would if such conduct had occurred in" Pennsylvania. Dillaman v. DOT, 2002 Pa. Commw. LEXIS 922, 811 A.2d 98 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts have acknowledged that unilateral amendments of compacts that have been ratified by Congress may violate Article I, section 10 of the United States Constitution, but, the Driver's License Compact is not reviewable under the United States Constitution because it did not receive the consent of Congress. Wroblewski v. Commonwealth, 2002 Pa. LEXIS 2195, 809 A.2d 247 (Pa. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court held that Pennsylvania was the "home state" for purposes of the Compact, because licensee had a Pennsylvania license at the time of his arrest and conviction and it made no difference that he surrendered his Pennsylvania license in return for a Maryland license the day after his New Jersey conviction. Evans v. Commonwealth, 2002 Pa. Commw. LEXIS 488, 800 A.2d 1001 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat.
        §
        1586, a different degree of impairment required to convict for driving while ability impaired or a similar charge, as reported by a party state, than the degree required under Pennsylvania law does not keep the party state's law from being "substantially similar" to Article IV(a)(2) of the Compact; consequently, it will not prevent a license suspension under Pennsylvania law. Squire v. DOT, 769 A.2d 1224, 2001 Pa. Commw. LEXIS 107 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2001). See also Lafferty v. DOT, 735 A.2d 1289 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1999); Barrett v. DOT, 746 A.2d 658 (Pa. Commw.

        Section 1584 [75 Pa.C.S.
        §
        1584], as amended in 1988 to state that the omission of information from a report sent by a member state pursuant to Article III of the Compact does not excuse Pennsylvania from complying with its duties under Articles IV and V of the Compact, does not violate due process notice requirements; as long as the notice given to the person whose license is being suspended is "sufficient notice of the conduct that forms the basis for a deprivation so that the respondent may adequately prepare a defense," due process notice requirements are satisfied.

        The Driver License Compact does not violate the double jeopardy, equal protection, and due process provisions of the U.S. Constitution. DOT v. McCafferty, 563 Pa. 146, 758 A.2d 1155, 2000 Pa. LEXIS 2383 (2000). See also Smega v. Commonwealth, 727 A.2d 154 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1999); Pepperling v. DOT, 737 A.2d 310 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Article III of the Driver License Compact, which contains specific requirements for reports of conviction, only obligates Pennsylvania when it is the reporting state, not the home state; consequently, Pennsylvania DOT is not precluded from relying on an out-of-state report because of perceived deficiencies in the convicting state's report of conviction. DOT v. McCafferty, 563 Pa. 146, 758 A.2d 1155, 2000 Pa. LEXIS 2383 (2000). See also Renna v. DOT, 762 A.2d 785 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2000); Baker v. DOT, 762 A.2d 795 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2000); Geesaman v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Plea of guilty "with a civil reservation" under New Jersey law, which allows a court to accept a guilty plea but order that it will not be used as evidence in any subsequent civil proceeding, does not preclude Pennsylvania DOT from using the conviction as evidence for license suspension pursuant to the Compact when a Pennsylvania license holder was convicted of DUI in New Jersey; DOT is acting solely upon the conviction, so how the conviction came about is not relevant. Bourdeev v. Commonwealth, 755 A.2d 59, 2000 Pa. Commw. LEXIS 295 (Pa.Commw. Ct. 2000). See also Hunt v. DOT, 750 A.2d 922 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2000); Teti v. DOT, 767 A.2d 647 (Pa. Commw.

        Pennsylvania DOT could not suspend driving privileges for Kentucky DUI conviction because Kentucky was not at the time of the conviction a party to the Driver License Compact. Schuetz v. DOT, 753 A.2d 915, 2000 Pa. Commw. LEXIS 341 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        In statutory appeal from a suspension of a driver's license under the Compact, the initial burden of proof is on the Department of Transportation to produce a record of the foreign conviction; the burden of proof then shifts to the licensee to rebut any inferences drawn from the record. Scott v. DOT, 730 A.2d 539, 1999 Pa. Commw.LEXIS 378 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because Maryland law permitted expunging DUI conviction upon successful completion of a rehabilitation program, and expressly stated that such discharge from probation was without judgment of conviction, Pennsylvania DOT did not have the authority to suspend a Pennsylvania driver's license based on the out-of-state conviction provisions of the Compact. Laughlin v. DOT, 719 A.2d 850, 1998 Pa. Commw. LEXIS 819 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Driver License Compact became effective when the Pennsylvania Legislature passed a statute adopting it, not when the Legislature passed a law delegating to the Secretary of Transportation the authority to enter into the Compact; consequently, appellee's license could not be suspended for an out-of-state conviction that occurred more than a year before the Legislature enacted the Compact into law. Sullivan v. DOT, 550 Pa. 639, 708 A.2d 481, 1998 Pa. LEXIS 165 (1998). See also Moreland v. DOT, 701 A.2d 294 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1997); Touring v. DOT, 712 A.2d 349 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1997).

        Rhode Island: When New Hampshire authorities transmitted a copy of a Notice of Action to the Registry, indicating that petitioner had been convicted of driving while intoxicated to Rhode Island authorities pursuant to the Driver License Compact, the document became a public record of the State of Rhode Island upon receipt; consequently, it was admissible under Rhode Island rules of evidence "by proof of custody without more." DePasquale v. Harrington, 599 A.2d 314, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 156 (R.I. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in the language of the Compact requires a reporting state to provide notice to the home state of any civil or regulatory actions initiated within the reporting state as to Licensee's reciprocal driving privileges within that state. Additionally, even if such notice, although not required, were provided by the reporting state, nothing within the Compact language requires or authorizes the home state to act upon such notice.
