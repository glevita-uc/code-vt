       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       In order to limit the circumstances under which agricultural operations may be deemed to be a nuisance, especially when nonagricultural land uses are initiated near existing agricultural operations, no locality shall adopt any ordinance that requires that a special exception or special use permit be obtained for any production agriculture or silviculture activity in an area that is zoned as an agricultural district or classification. Localities may adopt setback requirements, minimum area requirements, and other requirements that apply to land on which agriculture and silviculture activity is occurring within the locality that is zoned as an agricultural district or classification. No locality shall enact zoning ordinances that would unreasonably restrict or regulate farm structures or farming and forestry practices in an agricultural district or classification unless such restrictions bear a relationship to the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. This section shall become effective on April 1, 1995, and from and after that date all land zoned to an agricultural district or classification shall be in conformity with this section.

      <p>
       The Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry, in consultation with the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, and the Virginia Department of Forestry, shall assist the Governor in developing objective guidelines and criteria that shall be used in awarding grants from the Fund. The guidelines may include a requirement for the affected localities to provide matching funds, which may be cash or in-kind, at the discretion of the Governor. The guidelines may require that as a condition of receiving any grant incentive that is based on employment goals, a recipient company must provide copies of employer quarterly payroll reports provided to the Virginia Employment Commission to verify the employment status of any position included in the employment goal. The guidelines and criteria shall include provisions for geographic diversity, a requirement that a project purchase a minimum percentage of Virginia-grown or Virginia-produced agricultural or forestal products to which its processes are adding value, and a cap on the amount of funds to be provided to any individual project.

        Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter or in the guidelines established pursuant to § 3.2-305, each political subdivision that receives a grant or loan from the Fund shall enter into a contract with each business beneficiary of moneys from the Fund. A person or entity shall be a business beneficiary of funds from the Fund if grant or loan moneys awarded from the Fund by the Governor are paid to a political subdivision and (i) subsequently distributed by the political subdivision to the person or entity or (ii) used by the political subdivision for the benefit of the person or entity but never distributed to the person or entity.

The contract shall include a formula for purposes of determining the portion of such funds to be repaid. The formula shall, in part, be based upon the fair market value of all funds that have been provided by the Commonwealth and the political subdivision and the extent to which the business beneficiary has met the private investment and minimum purchase requirements. Any such funds repaid to the political subdivision that relate to the award from the Fund shall promptly be paid by the political subdivision to the Commonwealth by payment remitted to the State Treasurer.

Copies of the notice shall be sent to the district where the agricultural activity is located. The notice shall state that, within 60 days of the receipt of the notice, the owner or operator shall submit to the Commissioner and district an agricultural stewardship plan that includes stewardship measures needed to prevent or cease the pollution. The district shall review the plan and, if the plan includes such measures, the Commissioner shall approve the plan within 30 days after he receives it. Upon approving the owner's or operator's plan, the Commissioner shall inform the owner or operator and the complainant that a plan has been approved.

The Commissioner may grant an extension of up to 180 days if: (i) a hardship exists; and (ii) the request for an extension was made not later than 60 days before the scheduled completion date. The Commissioner shall, within 30 days of receiving the request, inform the owner or operator whether or not an extension has been granted.

      <p>
       The Commissioner shall direct abundance surveys for plant pests and may carry out operations or measures to locate, suppress, control, eradicate, prevent, or retard the spread of pests. When the Commissioner determines that a new or dangerous or highly injurious plant pest exists within the Commonwealth or that an established pest requires control and the nature of the pest dictates immediate action, he may proceed with eradication or suppression. Provided further, that whenever the Commissioner intends to go upon any property for the purpose of eradicating or suppressing pests, he shall before entering upon any such property, give a written notice to the owner or occupant thereof at least 24 hours prior to such entry, setting forth in detail the purpose or purposes for which such entry shall be made.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the event the Commissioner determines a plant pest does not require immediate action, he shall report his findings, including the nature of the pest and method of proposed treatment, to the Board in writing and to the property owners or persons in charge of the property concerned by printing a copy thereof, at least once, in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the locality concerned. In case of objection to the action proposed, an appeal shall lie to the Board. Such appeal shall be taken within seven days from the issue of the notice and shall act as a stay of proceedings insofar as the property of the person noting the appeal is concerned until it is heard and decided.

      <p>
       The Board may quarantine the Commonwealth or any portion thereof when it determines that such action is necessary to prevent or retard the spread of a pest into, within, or from the Commonwealth. Before a quarantine is adopted, the Board shall, after due public notice, hold a public hearing in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.02.2.html#t2.2sIIp0Bc40a01s2.2-4000" target="_blank">§ 2.2-4000</a></cite> et seq.), at which hearing any interested party may appear and be heard either in person or by attorney. Notwithstanding the provisions of <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.02.2.html#t2.2sIIp0Bc40a01s2.2-4002" target="_blank">§ 2.2-4002</a></cite> or any other law to the contrary, the Commissioner may impose a temporary quarantine for a period not to exceed 90 days. A public hearing, as provided herein, shall be held if it appears that a quarantine for more than the 90-day period will be necessary to prevent or retard the spread of the pest. The Commissioner shall give notice of the establishment of the quarantine in a newspaper having general circulation in the area affected by the quarantine. The Commissioner may limit the application of the temporary or permanent quarantine to the infested area and appropriate environs, to be known as the regulated areas, and may without further hearing extend or reduce the regulated area upon publication of a notice to that effect in a newspaper having general circulation in the area affected by the quarantine or by direct written notice to those concerned. Any temporary quarantine imposed by the Commissioner or any extensions or reductions in the regulated areas pursuant to this section shall be reviewed by the Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting, such review by the Board shall be made within 90 days of the Commissioner's action.
    <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Following establishment of a quarantine, no person shall move any regulated article described in the quarantine or move the pest against which the quarantine is established, within, from, into, or through the Commonwealth contrary to regulations.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The regulations may restrict the movement of the pest and any regulated articles from the regulated area in the Commonwealth into or through other parts of the Commonwealth or other states and from the regulated area in other states into or through the Commonwealth and shall impose such inspection, disinfection, certification, or permit and other requirements as the Commissioner deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this article. The Commissioner may issue administrative instructions relating to the enforcement of regulations including acceptable certification procedures, regulated articles, and exemptions.

The owner of any property destroyed or ordered to be treated or otherwise disposed of under this section may, in an action against the Commonwealth in the appropriate court, recover just compensation for any property so destroyed or the reasonable costs of disposal of any property so ordered if he establishes that the property was not a pest, or a host, or an infested article.

       The Cotton Board, established by the passage of a referendum held pursuant to Chapter 873 of the Acts of Assembly of 1997, is continued within the Department. The Cotton Board shall be composed of eight members appointed by the Governor, each of whom shall be a resident of Virginia and a producer in Virginia. The Governor shall be guided in his appointments from nominations made by the following agricultural organizations: (i) the Virginia Cotton Growers Association, Inc.; (ii) the Virginia Farm Bureau Federation; and (iii) any other organization within the Commonwealth that is recognized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a certified cotton grower organization representing Virginia producers pursuant to guidelines authorized by the Cotton Research and Promotion Act (7 U.S.C. §§ 2101-2118). Each such agricultural organization may nominate producers from each production area. The Governor shall appoint a producer residing in each such production area. If no producer resides in a particular production area, the Governor shall appoint a qualified producer from any other production area. Each agricultural organization shall submit nominations for each available position before the expiration of the member's term for which the nomination is being provided. If said agricultural organizations fail to provide the nominations, the Governor may appoint other nominees that meet the foregoing criteria. Five members of the Cotton Board shall constitute a quorum.

Each organization shall submit nominations or recommendations for each available position. If the organizations fail to provide the nominations, the Governor may appoint other nominees that meet the foregoing criteria.

        <br/>
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Any manufacturer who is required to collect the equine feed assessment under this article and who has not paid the assessment to the Commissioner within 15 working days following the due date of February 1 shall pay to the Commissioner a late fee of 10 percent of the amount due or $50, whichever is greater, in addition to the amount of assessment owed. The appraisal of this late fee shall not prevent the Commissioner from taking other action, as provided for in this chapter. If any person is delinquent in any payment of the money due, then the amount shall be collected by civil action in the name of the Commonwealth at the direction of the Commissioner, and any person adjudged to be in default shall pay the cost of such action. The Attorney General, at the request of the Commissioner, shall institute action in any appropriate court for the collection of any money due, including interest thereon.

         There is hereby established in the state treasury a special fund to be designated the "Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalization Endowment." The Endowment shall receive any proceeds from any sale of all or any portion of the Commission Allocation, and any gifts, grants and contributions that are specifically designated for inclusion in such Endowment. No part of the Endowment, neither corpus nor income, or interest thereon, shall revert to the general fund of the state treasury. The Endowment shall be under the management and control of the Treasury Board, and the Treasury Board shall have such powers and authority as may be necessary to exercise such management and control consistent with the provisions of this section. The income of the Endowment shall be paid out, not less than annually, to the Fund. In addition, up to six percent of the corpus of the Endowment shall be paid to the Fund annually upon request of the Commission, by majority vote, to the Treasury Board. Upon two-thirds vote of the Commission, up to 10 percent of the corpus of the Endowment shall be so paid. Upon three-fourths vote of the Commission, up to 15 percent of the corpus of the Endowment shall be so paid. No use of proceeds shall be made that would cause bonds issued on a tax-exempt basis to be deemed taxable. For purposes of this section, "income" of the Endowment means at the time of determination the lesser of the available cash in, or the realized investment income for the applicable period of, the Endowment, and "corpus" of the Endowment means at the time of determination the sum of the proceeds from the sale of all or any portion of the Commission Allocation, any gifts, grants, and contributions that have been credited to such Endowment, and any income not appropriated and withdrawn from the Endowment prior to June 30 of each year, less withdrawals from the corpus. Determinations by the Treasury Board, or the State Treasurer on behalf of the Treasury Board, as to the amount of income or the amount of the corpus shall be conclusive.

         The Treasury Board shall serve as trustee of the Endowment and the corpus and income of the Endowment shall be withdrawn and credited to the Fund by order of the Treasury Board as provided in subsection A. The State Treasurer shall be custodian of the funds credited to the Endowment. The Treasury Board shall have full power to invest and reinvest funds credited to the Endowment in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (§ 64.2-1100 et seq.) and, in addition, as otherwise provided by law. The Treasury Board may borrow money in such amounts as may be necessary whenever in its judgment it would be more advantageous to borrow money than to sell securities held for the Fund. Any debt so incurred may be evidenced by notes duly authorized by resolution of the Treasury Board, such notes to be retired no later than the end of the biennium in which such debt is incurred. The Treasury Board may commingle, for purposes of investment, the corpus of the Endowment provided that it shall appropriately account for the investments credited to the Endowment. The Treasury Board may hire independent investment advisors and managers as it deems appropriate to assist with investing the Endowment. The expenses of making and disposing of investments, such as brokerage commissions, legal expenses related to a particular transaction, investment advisory and management fees and expenses, transfer taxes, and other customary transactional expenses shall be payable out of the income of the Endowment.

        The Commission, after a public hearing and investigation, may establish the prices to be paid producers or associations of producers by distributors in any market, may fix the minimum and maximum wholesale and maximum retail prices to be charged for milk in any market, and may also establish different prices for different grades or classes of milk.

In determining the reasonableness of prices to be paid or charged in any market for any grade, quantity, or class of milk, the Commission shall be guided by all pertinent economic factors relevant to production, processing, and distribution of milk as they affect the public interest in maintaining an adequate supply of milk within the Commonwealth, including compliance with all sanitary regulations in force in such market, necessary operation, processing, storage, and delivery charges, the prices of other foods, and the welfare of the general public. The Commission may adopt a formula incorporating these economic factors that will adjust automatically the prices to be paid producers or associations of producers by distributors in any market, and then provide for the automatic adjustment of resale prices according to the result obtained by the use of this formula. Public hearings shall not be required for price adjustments obtained by use of a formula, but shall be held for adoption or amendment of the formula itself.

    - Under this section minimum prices may be fixed on the basis of representative reasonable total cost of the essential factors, and maximum prices allowed because of single items of cost peculiar to some distributors. Thus, if minimum and maximum prices are fixed, the spread between them will allow the distributor who renders a service different from that of another to make a charge commensurate with the service rendered. The consumer may choose whether he desires the extra service. Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Milk Comm'n, <cite class="va_code">197 Va. 69</cite>, 87 S.E.2d 769 (1955).

     There is no authority for the fixing of a minimum price alone.

    The only power granted is to fix "minimum and maximum prices."

         Where the Commission adopted a regulation for a particular area which fixed the minimum price of the several grades of milk delivered in glass containers and added to that price one cent per quart for the same grades delivered in other than glass containers, it was held that the regulation was invalid insofar as it undertook to establish a difference in price for the same grade of milk, based upon the type of the container in which the milk was sold.

     Cost of container is factor to be considered.

    - Under this section, in fixing the different prices for different grades of milk, it is mandatory that the Commission take into consideration all of the factors and elements involved in its production, processing, storage and distribution, and necessarily included in these factors is the cost of some form of container.

         <b>
     But cannot be basis for price differential.

    - Having taken into consideration all of the factors, once a price is fixed for a grade of milk it must be the same for all milk of that grade, and that is not varied by the fact that it may be delivered in glass jars, tin cans, or paper cups, or by automobile or horse and wagon. Lucerne Cream &amp; Butter Co. v. Milk Comm'n, <cite class="va_code">182 Va. 490</cite>, 29 S.E.2d 397 (1944).

         To eliminate, in part or whole, an essential factor in the cost of distribution in the determination of the reasonableness of the price to be charged for a specific grade of milk in a designated area, and thereafter to use that factor as a basis for a differential in price for the same grade of milk, is violative of the letter and the spirit of this section in form and in substance.

         The Commission cannot validly set up a classification based upon one of the factors enumerated in this section for the purpose of establishing a differential in price for the same grade of milk.

     Classification according to method of distribution not permitted.
    </b>
    - The words "grade, quantity, or class" refer to and qualify the word "milk." They permit classification of milk according to "grade, quantity, or class." They do not permit classification according to the method of distribution; i.e., whether by home-delivery or store-delivery. The quality of the milk of a particular grade or class is not affected merely by reason of the method of delivery, the character of its container, or the quantity involved. Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Milk Comm'n, <cite class="va_code">197 Va. 69</cite>, 87 S.E.2d 769 (1955).

         <b>
     Discount based on quantity.
    </b>
    - A discount based on quantity is not a price differential based on grade such as is prohibited. The price is the same for the same grade in any quantity involved. A differential measured by quantity results in no discrimination between distributors or between consumers. It applies to all alike, and allows an economic saving both to seller and purchaser.

     Effect of acquiescence in improper practice.

    - The Commission could not avoid compliance with this section because its practice over a period of years had been to fix a differential based on method of delivery, or because others had previously acquiesced in this practice.

        The Commission shall have no authority to establish a minimum retail price for milk, except upon a determination after a public hearing that the absence of a minimum retail price has caused or is about to cause a disruption in the Virginia milk market or some segment of the market that is likely to depress the producer price or has caused or is likely to cause a substantial reduction in competition between processor-distributors in an area, so as to adversely affect the public health and welfare that requires an adequate supply of milk at reasonable and fair prices.

          Purpose of license.
         </b>
         - The obvious purpose of the license is to provide the Commission and the members of the local boards with a record of the distributors and producers subject to this chapter. Supervision and enforcement are thus likely to be easier. Highland Farms Dairy, Inc. v. Agnew, 300 U.S. 608, 57 S. Ct. 549, 81 L. Ed. 835 (1937).

         <b>
     License application constitutes agreement to conform.
    </b>
    - For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter, the Commission, under this section, requires all distributors in any market designated by the Commission to be licensed by it. When a distributor applies for a license, he agrees to conform to the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations of the Commission. Granted a license he is at liberty to surrender it; but if he desires to operate as a distributor, he must conform to the provisions of the chapter and the rules, regulations and orders of the Commission promulgated thereunder.

          Power of Commission to grant or refuse license is not absolute.
         </b>
         - The license provisions of this chapter should not be interpreted to vest the Commission with the absolute power to grant or refuse licenses, if any other reasonable construction can be adopted. Highland Farms Dairy, Inc. v. Agnew, 16 F. Supp. 575 (E.D. Va. 1936), aff'd, 300 U.S. 608, 57 S. Ct. 549, 81 L. Ed. 835 (1937).
        </p>
        <p>
         It was not the intent of the legislature to confer upon the administrative board the extraordinary power to determine at will who should and who should not engage in the distribution of milk, but rather to render available to the Milk Commission and the local boards a list of authorized distributors of milk and to enable the authorities more readily to supervise the business of distribution and to enforce the rules, regulations, and orders promulgated by the board. Highland Farms Dairy, Inc. v. Agnew, 16 F. Supp. 575 (E.D. Va. 1936), aff'd, 300 U.S. 608, 57 S. Ct. 549, 81 L. Ed. 835 (1937).
        </p>
        <p>
         In the absence of provision to the contrary, it would appear to be the duty of the Commission to issue a license to any distributor complying with the statute and to preserve his license until some violation of the act or of a regulation or order had taken place. Highland Farms Dairy, Inc. v. Agnew, 16 F. Supp. 575 (E.D. Va. 1936), aff'd, 300 U.S. 608, 57 S. Ct. 549, 81 L. Ed. 835 (1937).

     Denial of license requires showing of "destructive competition."
    </b>
    - That an area is adequately served by a number of other licensed distributors is not a valid basis for the denial of an application in the absence of evidence that the issuance of a license would tend to "a destructive competition" in the market.

    - Clear and convincing evidence is required to show that granting of a distributor's license will cause destructive competition on the milk market. Beatrice Foods Co. v. State Milk Comm'n, <cite class="va_code">205 Va. 763</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 922 (1965).

     Effect of denying license.

     Improper denial of license.
    </b>
    - It was arbitrary and capricious for the Commission to refuse a license to a dairy cooperative association on grounds that the operation of such a business constitutes a rebate in violation of a Commission regulation, where the evidence indicated that the Commission had licensed other such cooperatives. Richmond Food Stores, Inc. v. State Milk Comm'n, <cite class="va_code">204 Va. 46</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 35 (1963).
        </p>
        <p>
         The Commission erred in denying a license to a prospective distributor on grounds that there were already two or more distributors in the market who were rendering adequate service. Such action by the Commission creates a monopoly for existing distributors, stifles competition, and abolishes free enterprise. Richmond Food Stores, Inc. v. State Milk Comm'n, <cite class="va_code">204 Va. 46</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 35 (1963).
        </p>
        <p>
         The Commission erred in denying a distributor's license on grounds that the applicant did not, as required by the Commission's regulations, "have facilities" for pasteurizing and bottling his milk, since he did not own such facilities. He had them available through arrangement with other parties and was thus able to satisfy the purpose of the regulation, which was to assure proper handling of the milk. Brown v. State Milk Comm'n, <cite class="va_code">205 Va. 18</cite>, 135 S.E.2d 98 (1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         The Commission erred in denying a license on grounds that the applicant had operated without a license prior to the date of the hearing. The applicant was distributing milk at the time the Commission enlarged the territory and embraced that in which he had been operating, he made timely application for a license effective in the area wherein he had been operating, and the delay in passing on his application was occasioned by no fault of his.

     Weight of Commission's finding of fact.

    - The Supreme Court is not bound by the Commission's finding of fact. Beatrice Foods Co. v. State Milk Comm'n, <cite class="va_code">205 Va. 763</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 922 (1965).
        </p>
        <p>
         Any presumption of the correctness of the findings is much weakened when the arbiter is a party to the controversy. The Commission would be less than human if it were not interested in upholding its own action. Beatrice Foods Co. v.

         Subsection (4) of this section requires that the court give the order of the Commission "the weight of a jury verdict on a fact found."

The expenses of the Commission, including salaries and the per diem of such personnel as the Commission finds it necessary to employ to properly carry out its functions under this chapter shall be met by an assessment of not over five cents ($0.05) per 100 pounds of milk, and cream (converted to terms of milk) handled by distributors and not over five cents ($0.05) per 100 pounds of milk, and cream (converted to terms of milk) sold by producers; these assessments to be the same per 100 pounds on producers and distributors. The exact amount of each monthly or semimonthly assessment shall be determined by the Commission as necessary to cover its expenses. All assessments shall be paid at the time the distributors pay the producers for the milk. All officers and employees of the Commission, who handle funds of the Commission or who sign or countersign checks upon such funds, shall severally give bond in such amount and with such sureties as shall be determined by the Commission. The cost of the bonds shall be paid by the Commission and the Commission shall determine the amount and sufficiency of the bonds.

    - This article is not invalid because it authorizes the levying of an assessment without giving any notice thereof. The distributor and the producer do not need formal notice. They know at all times that an assessment will be made and they can, periodically, determine for themselves just how much it will be. In addition to this, it is quite clear that the assessment is not the levying of a tax, nor is the act a revenue measure. It is merely incident to the regulation, and is proper under the police power of the State. Reynolds v.

         § 1. Statement of purpose, findings, and declaration of policy.
         <br/>
        </h5>
        <p>
         The purpose of this compact is to recognize the interstate character of the southern dairy industry and the prerogative of the states under the United States Constitution to form an interstate commission for the southern region. The mission of the Commission is to take such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability of dairy farming in the South, and to assure consumers of an adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.
         <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         The participating states find and declare that the dairy industry is an essential agricultural activity of the South. Dairy farms, and associated suppliers, marketers, processors, and retailers, are an integral component of the region's economy. Their ability to provide a stable, local supply of pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the region.
         <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         The participating states further find that dairy farms are essential, and they are an integral part of the region's rural communities. The farms preserve land for agricultural purposes and provide needed economic stimuli for rural communities.
         <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         By entering into this compact, the participating states affirm that their ability to regulate the price that southern dairy farmers receive for their product is essential to the public interest. Assurance of a fair and equitable price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk to the market and the vitality of the southern dairy industry, with all the associated benefits.
         <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         Recent dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the southern dairy region. Historically, individual state regulatory action had been an effective emergency remedy available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The system of federal orders, implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, establishes only minimum prices paid to producers for raw milk, without preempting the power of states to regulate milk prices above the minimum levels so established.
         <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         In today's regional dairy marketplace, cooperative, rather than individual state action is needed to more effectively address the market disarray. Under our constitutional system, properly authorized states acting cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate interstate commerce than they may assert individually without such authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution.
         <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority over the region's fluid milk market by this compact, the participating states declare their purpose that this compact neither displace the system of federal orders nor encourage the merging of federal orders. Specific provisions of the compact itself set forth this basic principle.
         <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         Designed as a flexible mechanism able to adjust to changes in a regulated marketplace, the compact also contains a contingency provision should the system of federal orders be discontinued. In that event, the interstate commission may regulate the marketplace in lieu of the system of federal orders. This contingent authority does not anticipate such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is only provided should developments in the market other than establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the system of federal orders.

     Both directions for use and warning required where necessary.
    </b>
    - The statutes require the manufacturer of an economic poison to give both directions for use and a warning where necessary. There is no inference that these two requirements are in the alternative, nor is there anything to suggest that a manufacturer can avoid his duty to warn or caution by giving directions for use. The two requirements, while they have the common purpose of protecting the public, are intended to do so in different ways. The directions are required to assure effective use, the warning to assure safe use. McClanahan v.

       <p>
        There is a statutory duty to warn whenever such warning is necessary to prevent injury to the objects outlined in the statute, and it is immaterial whether these objects are the things being treated or whether they are the things which are injured as a result of the incidental dangers not connected with the purpose for which the product is used. The language of the statute is broad and unequivocal and requires a warning or caution statement whenever necessary to prevent injury to man or animal, vegetation or useful insect. McClanahan v. California Spray-Chemical Corp., <cite class="va_code">194 Va. 842</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 712 (1953) (decided under former

     "Agricultural commodity."
    </b>
    - Irrigation is not a necessary element for a farm pond to qualify for the agricultural exemption, provided the impounded waters are utilized in a manner found to be required for agricultural production. The determination of whether the agricultural exemption applies to any particular structure is primarily a factual question reserved to the Director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation on a case-by-case basis. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Thomas C. Wright, Jr., Member, House of Delegates,<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.12.html#t12c12-074" target="_blank"> 12-074</a></cite>, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 1 (1/4/13).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent a specific definition in the Dam Safety Act, it is appropriate to look to the definition of the term "forester" provided in the statutes governing the Department of Forestry as an interpretative guide, and that a forester differs from an orchardist in that an orchardist harvests fruit, nuts or sap from trees, while a forester is concerned with the timber itself. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Thomas C. Wright, Jr., Member, House of Delegates,<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.12.html#t12c12-074" target="_blank"> 12-074</a></cite>, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 1 (1/4/13).

     Registration of employee as pest control technician.
    </b>
    - In an action for damages by homeowners against a pesticide company and its employee, the trial court erred when it sustained demurrers to negligence counts because the homeowners alleged that the company and the employee breached duties independent of the company's contractual duty to control pests, including allowing the employee to apply commercial pesticide without a commercial pesticide certification or without first being registered as a pest control technician.

        - The statute does not violate the due process clause of the federal Constitution, notwithstanding the contention that the statute effectively aims to neutralize the economic impact of the Master Settlement Agreement on participating cigarette manufacturers by placing equivalent financial burdens on nonparticipating manufacturers, who are competitors of the participating manufacturers, and that the statute deprives nonparticipating competitors of their property for 25 years either to force them to sign the Master Settlement Agreement or to impose on them a competitive disadvantage that they otherwise would not have suffered because they engaged in no wrongdoing, as the statute's stated and legitimate purpose was to ensure that Virginia will be able to recover healthcare costs from cigarette manufacturers regardless of whether the manufacturer has signed on to the Master Settlement Agreement and the statute is rationally related to such purpose. Star Sci., Inc. v. Beales, 278 F.3d 339, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 872 (4th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 818, 123 S. Ct. 93, 154 L. Ed. 2d 24 (2002).

        The statute does not violate the equal protection clause of the federal Constitution, notwithstanding the argument that the statute treats tobacco companies differently based on whether or not they joined the Master Settlement Agreement and that this differential treatment is not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, as the distinctions are rationally related to Virginia's legitimate purpose of ensuring a source of recovery from all manufacturers for Virginia's future costs related to cigarette smoking.

       <p>
        The statute does not violate the commerce clause of the federal Constitution, even though it requires a cigarette manufacturer to make payments on cigarettes sold by it to independent distributors in other states if the cigarettes are later sold into Virginia, as the statute imposes a fee only for cigarettes actually sold within the state and has no effect on transactions undertaken by out-of-state distributors in other states, and to the extent that the statute may affect the prices charged by out-of-state distributors, the effect is applicable only to prices charged on cigarettes sold within Virginia.

       <p>
        The statute does not violate the compact clause of the federal Constitution, notwithstanding the assertion that the Master Settlement Agreement is in fact an interstate compact and is invalid because it has not been approved by Congress, as the Master Settlement Agreement does not increase the power of the states at the expense of federal supremacy and, therefore, is not an interstate compact requiring congressional approval.

     Authority of Attorney General.
    </b>
    - Virginia Attorney General lacked the authority to preclude a tobacco manufacturer from doing business in the Commonwealth, by excluding it from the statutory directory, solely on the ground that the manufacturer failed to pay statutory penalties proposed by the Attorney General, but not yet adjudicated by the courts; hence, the Attorney General's power to insist upon a cure before listing a manufacturer in the directory did not include the power to impose a civil penalty for alleged past noncompliance.

       Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection B of § 3.2-4201, a tobacco product manufacturer who elects to place funds into escrow pursuant to subdivision A 2 of § 3.2-4201 may make an irrevocable assignment of its interest in the funds to the benefit of the Commonwealth.

Any interest or other appreciation withdrawn from the subject escrow account prior to the time of assignment shall not be a part of the assignment. The tobacco product manufacturer, the Attorney General, and the financial institution where the escrow account is maintained shall make such amendments to the qualified escrow account agreement, title to the account, and the account itself as may be necessary to effectuate an irrevocable assignment of rights executed pursuant to this section or a withdrawal or payment of funds from the escrow account pursuant to § 3.2-4203. An assignment of rights executed pursuant to this section shall be in writing, signed by a duly authorized representative of the tobacco product manufacturer making the assignment, and shall become effective upon delivery of the assignment to the Attorney General and the financial institution where the escrow account is maintained.

      <p>
       From such funds as may be appropriated by the General Assembly and any gifts, grants, or donations from public or private sources, there is hereby created in the state treasury a special nonreverting, permanent fund to be known as the Beehive Grant Fund (the Fund), to be administered by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The Fund shall be established on the books of the Comptroller. Interest earned on moneys in the Fund shall remain in the Fund and be credited to it. Any moneys remaining in the Fund at the end of each fiscal year, including interest thereon, shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. Expenditures and disbursements from the Fund, which shall be in the form of grants, shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the Comptroller upon the written request signed by the Commissioner. Grants from the Fund shall only be made for the purposes of the beehive distribution program pursuant to § 3.2-4416.

      <p>
       Any individual registered with the Department as a beekeeper may apply to the Department for no more than three basic beehive units per year per household. The Department shall establish guidelines setting forth the components of a basic beehive unit and the general requirements for qualifying for such unit. The Department shall accept applications for beehive units during an application period of not less than 15 days. The Department shall select individuals receiving beehive units at random from the completed eligible applications received during the application period. In the event that funds are not available in the Beehive Grant Fund established pursuant to § 3.2-4415 (the Fund), the Department shall notify individuals who submitted applications but were not selected to receive beehive units that the funds available for that fiscal year have been exhausted. The Department shall not be required to carry forward pending applications to the next fiscal year in which funds are available in the Fund.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department may use funds from the Fund to pay for the costs of purchasing, building, or distributing the beehive units and for the costs of administering the beehive distribution program. The Department may work cooperatively with the Virginia Cooperative Extension Service and Agricultural Experiment Station Division, established pursuant to Article 2 (§ 23.1-2608 et seq.) of Chapter 26 of Title 23.1, to carry out the provisions of this section.

     Action on contract to sell feed.

    - Plaintiff sold defendant a commodity designated in the contract as "Winter Wheat Bran." In an action by plaintiff against defendant for failure to accept the bran, evidence that under the usage or custom of the trade "Winter Wheat Bran" contained a certain percentage of screenings, did not contravene the provisions of the state statutes against the adulteration and misbranding of commercial feeding stuffs, it not being claimed that the screenings in the bran constituted an unlawful adulteration, nor that the tags which were in fact placed on the sacks, indicating the presence of screenings, constituted a misbranding.

The fact that the couple's home was also located on the farm did not cause a Fourth Amendment violation since property used for commercial purposes is treated differently for Fourth Amendment purposes from residential property and by operating their farm and home together, the couple opened themselves up to an intrusion that would not have been permissible in a purely private context.

      <p>
       Any poisonous or deleterious substance added to any food, except if it is required in the production of the food or cannot be avoided by good manufacturing practice, shall be deemed to be unsafe for purposes of subdivision 2 of § 3.2-5122; but when any poisonous or deleterious substance is required or cannot be avoided, the Board shall adopt regulations limiting the quantity to such extent as it finds necessary for the protection of public health. Any quantity exceeding the limits established by the Board shall also be deemed to be unsafe for purposes of the application of subdivision 2 of § 3.2-5122. While such regulation is in effect limiting the quantity of any poisonous or deleterious substance in any food, such food shall not, by reason of bearing or containing any added amount of such substance, be considered to be adulterated within the meaning of subdivision 1 of § 3.2-5122 if the added amount is not in excess of the limits established by the Board. In determining the quantity of any added substance to be tolerated in or on different articles of food, the Board shall take into account the extent to which the use of such substance is required or cannot be avoided in the production of each article, and the other ways in which the consumer may be affected by the same or other poisonous or deleterious substances.

     Manufacturer of food liable to consumer.

    - Where a manufacturer of food for human consumption sells such food in sealed containers or packages to a retailer, who in turn sells it to a consumer, and the consumer upon eating it suffers damage in consequence of impurities in the product shown to have existed therein before it left the manufacturer's hands, the manufacturer is liable to the consumer on its implied warranty of wholesomeness of the food, and the consumer may recover against the manufacturer for damages suffered, irrespective of a lack of privity of contract between the manufacturer and the consumer. This permits the placing of the loss occasioned upon the manufacturer who is in the best position to prevent the production and sale of unwholesome food. Swift &amp; Co. v.

     Refusal to submit to inspection.
    </b>
    - Husband and wife's misdemeanor convictions for violating the Virginia Food Act that resulted from their refusal to submit to a warrantless inspection of their goat cheese manufacturing facilities, was upheld on appeal because the state's significant interest in protecting the public health by inspecting facilities that manufacture and store food authorized warrantless inspections to promote the specific enforcement needs of the Virginia Food Act. The fact that the couple's home was also located on the farm did not cause a Fourth Amendment violation since property used for commercial purposes is treated differently for Fourth Amendment purposes from residential property and by operating their farm and home together, the couple opened themselves up to an intrusion that would not have been permissible in a purely private context.

       Any product referred to by § 3.2-5215 shall be liable to be proceeded against and condemned.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       At any time prior to the expiration of the 20-day detention period provided by § 3.2-5215, the Commissioner shall notify the attorney for the Commonwealth for the city or county where such detention was made in writing. Upon receiving written notification, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall forthwith file in the name of the Commonwealth any information against the detained product in the clerk's office of the circuit court of the county or city where the detention was made. Upon the filing of such information, the clerk of court shall forthwith issue a warrant directing the sheriff to seize the detained product and see to its transportation to a suitable place of storage that, if necessary, may be outside of the county or city served by the sheriff. Should the attorney for the Commonwealth, for any reason, fail to file such information within five days after receipt of written notice of detention of the product, the same may, at any time within 30 days thereafter be filed by the Attorney General and the proceedings thereon shall be the same as if filed by the attorney for the Commonwealth.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Such information shall allege the seizure, and set forth in general terms the grounds of forfeiture of the seized product, and shall petition that the same be condemned and sold and the proceeds disposed of according to law, and that all persons concerned or interested be cited to appear and show cause why such product should not be condemned and sold to enforce the forfeiture. After the filing of the information, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall apply to the judge of the court wherein the information was filed for a hearing on the matters contained in the information. The judge of the court shall move the cause to the head of the docket and the hearing shall be had as soon as practical to do so.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The owner of and all persons in any manner then indebted or liable for the purchase price of the product and any person having a lien thereon, if they be known to the attorney who files the information, shall be made parties defendant thereto, and shall be served with the notice provided for, in the manner provided by law for serving a notice, at least 10 days before the day specified for the hearing on the information, if they are residents of the Commonwealth; and if they are unknown or nonresidents, or cannot with reasonable diligence be found in the Commonwealth, they shall be deemed sufficiently served by publication of the notice once a week for two successive weeks in some newspaper published in the county or city, or if there be none published therein, then in some newspaper having general circulation, and a notice shall be sent by registered mail of such seizure to the last known address of the owner of the detained product.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Any person claiming to be the owner of such product or to hold a lien thereon, may appear at any time before final judgment of the trial court, and be made a party defendant to the information so filed, which appearance shall be by answer, under oath, in which shall be clearly set forth the nature of such defendant's claim, whether as owner or as lienor, and if as owner, the right or title by which he claims to be such owner, and if lienor, the amount and character of his lien, and the evidence thereof; and in either case, such defendant shall set forth fully any reason or cause that he may have to show against the forfeiture of the product.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If such product is condemned, it shall, after entry of the decree, be disposed of by destruction or sale as the court may direct and the proceeds, if sold, less the court costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses, shall be paid into the state treasury, but the product shall not be sold contrary to the regulations of the Board; provided, that upon the execution and delivery of a good and sufficient bond conditioned that the product shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of contrary to the regulations of the Board, the court may direct that such product be delivered to a claimant thereof, who may have appeared in the proceedings, subject to such supervision by the Commissioner as is necessary to insure compliance with the applicable regulations. When a decree of condemnation is entered against a product and it is released under bond, or destroyed, court costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses may, as the court deems just, be awarded against the person, if any, intervening as claimant of the product.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If a claimant denies for any reason that the product to be condemned is subject to condemnation as provided by this section, and shall demand a trial by jury of the issue thus made, then the court shall, under proper instructions, submit the same to a jury of five, to be selected and empanelled as prescribed by law. If the jury finds in favor of the claimant, or if the court, trying such issue without a jury, so finds, the judgment of the court shall be to entirely relieve the product from forfeiture, and no costs shall be taxed against such claimant.

        In addition to the penalties prescribed in § 3.2-5229 or 3.2-5232, any person violating any provision of this article or regulation adopted hereunder may be assessed a civil penalty by the Commissioner for each violation in an amount not to exceed $15,000. In determining the amount of any civil penalty, the Commissioner shall give due consideration to: (i) the previous violations committed by the person; (ii) the seriousness of the violation; and (iii) the demonstrated good faith of the person charged in attempting to achieve compliance with this article or the regulations adopted hereunder after notification of the violation. Any civil penalty shall be in addition to any payment that may be required for the wholesale value of all milk and milk products that must be destroyed as a consequence of such violation.

       <li id="t3.2sIVc52a04s3.2-5233ol1B">
        A civil penalty may be assessed by the Commissioner only after he has given the person charged with a violation an opportunity for a public hearing. Where such a public hearing has been held, the Commissioner shall make findings of fact and issue a written decision as to the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty that is warranted, incorporating, when appropriate, an order therein requiring that the penalty be paid. When appropriate, the Commissioner shall consolidate such hearings with other proceedings pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Any hearing under this section shall be a formal adjudicatory hearing in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.). When the person charged with such a violation fails to avail himself of the opportunity for a public hearing, a civil penalty shall be assessed by the Commissioner after the Commissioner determines that a violation has occurred and the amount of the penalty warranted, and issues an order requiring that the penalty be paid.
       </li>
       <li id="t3.2sIVc52a04s3.2-5233ol1C">
        Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the general fund of the state treasury. The Board shall prescribe procedures for payment of civil penalties. The procedures shall include provisions for a person to consent to abatement of the alleged violation and pay a penalty or negotiated sum in lieu of such penalty without admission of civil liability arising from such alleged violation.

       At any time prior to the expiration of the 20-day detention period provided by § 3.2-5413, the Commissioner shall notify the attorney for the Commonwealth for the city or county where such detention was made in writing of said detention. Upon receiving such written notification, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall forthwith file in the name of the Commonwealth an information against the detained property in the clerk's office of the circuit court of the county or city where detention was made. Upon the filing of such information, the clerk of court shall forthwith issue a warrant directing the sheriff to seize the detained property and see to its transportation to a suitable place of storage that, if necessary, may be outside of the county or city served by the sheriff. Should the attorney for the Commonwealth, for any reason, fail to file such information within five days after receipt of written notice of detention of articles or animals, the same may, at any time within 30 days thereafter be filed by the Attorney General and the proceedings thereon shall be the same as if filed by the attorney for the Commonwealth.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Such information shall allege the seizure, and set forth in general terms the grounds of forfeiture of the seized property, and shall petition that the same be condemned and sold and the proceeds disposed of according to law, and that all persons concerned or interested be cited to appear and show cause why such property should not be condemned and sold to enforce the forfeiture. After the filing of the information, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall apply to the judge of the court wherein the information was filed for a hearing on the matters contained in the information. The judge of the court shall move the matter to the head of the docket and such hearing shall be had as soon as practical to do so.

      <p>
       The owner of and all persons in any manner then indebted or liable for the purchase price of the article or animal, and any person having a lien thereon, if they be known to the attorney who files the information, shall be made parties defendant thereto, and shall be served with the notice hereinafter provided for, in the manner provided by law for serving a notice, at least ten days before the day therein specified for the hearing on the information, if they be residents of the Commonwealth; and if they be unknown or nonresidents, or cannot with reasonable diligence be found in the Commonwealth, they shall be deemed sufficiently served by publication of the notice once a week for two successive weeks in some newspaper published in such county or city, or if none be published therein, then in some newspaper having general circulation therein, and a notice shall be sent by registered mail of such seizure to the last known address of the owner of such article or animal. If any such person be served by publication, then no hearing shall be had prior to the expiration of 10 days from the date of the record publication of the notice.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Any person claiming to be the owner of such seized article or animal, or to hold a lien thereon, may appear at any time before final judgment of the trial court, and be made a party defendant to the information so filed, which appearance shall be in person or by answer, under oath, in which shall be clearly set forth the nature of such defendant's claim, whether as owner or as lienor, and if as owner, the right or title by which he claims to be such owner, and if lienor, the amount and character of his lien, and the evidence thereof; and in either case, such defendant shall set forth fully any reason or cause that he may have to show against the forfeiture of the article or animal.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If such article or animal is condemned, it shall, after entry of the decree, be disposed of by destruction or sale as the court may direct and the proceeds, if sold, less the court costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses, shall be paid into the treasury of the Commonwealth, but the article or animal shall not be sold contrary to the provisions of this chapter, or the Federal Meat Inspection Act or the Federal Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; provided, that upon the execution and delivery of a good and sufficient bond conditioned that the article or animal shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of contrary to the provisions of this chapter, or the laws of the United States, the court may direct that such article or animal be delivered to a claimant thereof, who may have appeared in the proceedings, subject to such supervision by the Commissioner as is necessary to insure compliance with the applicable laws. When a decree of condemnation is entered against the article or animal and it is released under bond, or destroyed, court costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses may as the court deems just, be awarded against the person, if any, intervening as claimant of the article or animal.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If a claimant shall deny for any reason that the article or animal to be condemned is subject to condemnation as provided by this section, and shall demand a trial by jury of the issue thus made, the court shall, under proper instructions, submit the same to a jury of five, to be selected and empanelled as prescribed by law, and if such jury shall find on the issue in favor of such claimant, or if the court, trying such issue without a jury, shall so find, the judgment of the court shall be to entirely relieve the property from forfeiture, and no costs shall be taxed against such claimant.

      <p>
       The Commissioner shall, on a periodic basis as he deems necessary, weigh or measure and inspect packages or amounts of commodities kept, offered, or exposed for sale, sold, or in the process of delivery, to determine whether the same contain the amounts represented and whether they be kept, offered, or exposed for sale, or sold, in accordance with law; and when such packages or amounts of commodities are found not to contain the amounts represented, or are found to be kept, offered, or exposed for sale in violation of law, the Commissioner may order them off sale and may so mark or tag them as to show them to be illegal. In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Commissioner may employ sampling and testing procedures as adopted by the National Conference on Weights and Measures, and published in National Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook 133, "Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods," and supplements thereto, or in any publication revising, supplementing, or superseding Handbook 133, for the inspection of packaged commodities in the Commonwealth, except insofar as modified or rejected by regulation. The procedures will determine compliance of a given lot of packages on the basis of the result obtained on a composite sample selected from, and representative of, such lot. No person shall: (i) sell, keep, offer, or expose for sale, any package or amount of commodity that has been ordered off sale or marked or tagged as provided in this section unless and until such package or amount of commodity has been brought into full compliance with all requirements of this chapter; or (ii) dispose of any package or amount of commodity that has been ordered off sale or marked or tagged as provided in this section, and that has not been brought into compliance with the requirements of this chapter, in any manner except with the specific approval of the Commissioner.

       Any cattle owner who uses a brand to identify his cattle must register his brand by applying to the Department for such registration. The application shall be made on forms prescribed and furnished by the Department, which application shall be accompanied by a fee of $10 and a facsimile of the brand to be registered shall also be furnished by the applicant. All fees collected hereunder for registration, transfer, and reregistration of brands shall be deposited in a special fund of the state treasury for the administration of this chapter. If the brand described in the application, or one similar, or closely resembling a registered brand has not been previously registered by another cattle owner, the Department shall approve the application, register the brand in the name of the applicant and issue to the applicant a certificate of registration. In the event the Department denies registration of a brand for any reason the registration fee of $10 shall be returned to the person making application for registration. When a cattle owner, who has registered a brand with the Department, transfers such brand to another, he shall immediately notify the Department of the transfer, giving the date of transfer, and the name of the transferee. Upon receipt of the notice and a transfer fee of $3, the Department shall note such transfer in the register of brands, and such brand shall not be used by the new owner until permission has been given by the Department.

       means the responsible practice of good animal husbandry, handling, production, management, confinement, feeding, watering, protection, shelter, transportation, treatment, and, when necessary, euthanasia, appropriate for the age, species, condition, size and type of the animal and the provision of veterinary care when needed to prevent suffering or impairment of health.

       "Adequate feed"
       means access to and the provision of food that is of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain each animal in good health; is accessible to each animal; is prepared so as to permit ease of consumption for the age, species, condition, size and type of each animal; is provided in a clean and sanitary manner; is placed so as to minimize contamination by excrement and pests; and is provided at suitable intervals for the species, age, and condition of the animal, but at least once daily, except as prescribed by a veterinarian or as dictated by naturally occurring states of hibernation or fasting normal for the species.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Adequate shelter"
       means provision of and access to shelter that is suitable for the species, age, condition, size, and type of each animal; provides adequate space for each animal; is safe and protects each animal from injury, rain, sleet, snow, hail, direct sunlight, the adverse effects of heat or cold, physical suffering, and impairment of health; is properly lighted; is properly cleaned; enables each animal to be clean and dry, except when detrimental to the species; during hot weather, is properly shaded and does not readily conduct heat; during cold weather, has a windbreak at its entrance and provides a quantity of bedding material consisting of hay, cedar shavings, or the equivalent that is sufficient to protect the animal from cold and promote the retention of body heat; and, for dogs and cats, provides a solid surface, resting platform, pad, floormat, or similar device that is large enough for the animal to lie on in a normal manner and can be maintained in a sanitary manner. Under this chapter, shelters whose wire, grid, or slat floors (i) permit the animals' feet to pass through the openings, (ii) sag under the animals' weight, or (iii) otherwise do not protect the animals' feet or toes from injury are not adequate shelter. The outdoor tethering of an animal shall not constitute the provision of adequate shelter (a) unless the animal is safe from predators and well suited and well equipped to tolerate its environment; (b) during the effective period for a hurricane warning or tropical storm warning issued for the area by the National Weather Service; or (c)(1) during a heat advisory issued by a local or state authority, (2) when the actual or effective outdoor temperature is 85 degrees Fahrenheit or higher or 32 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, or (3) during the effective period for a severe weather warning issued for the area by the National Weather Service, including a winter storm, tornado, or severe thunderstorm warning, unless an animal control officer, having inspected an animal's individual circumstances in clause (c)(1), (2), or (3), has determined the animal to be safe from predators and well suited and well equipped to tolerate its environment.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Adequate space"
       means sufficient space to allow each animal to (i) easily stand, sit, lie, turn about, and make all other normal body movements in a comfortable, normal position for the animal and (ii) interact safely with other animals in the enclosure. When an animal is tethered, "adequate space" means that the tether to which the animal is attached permits the above actions and is appropriate to the age and size of the animal; is attached to the animal by a properly applied collar, halter, or harness that is configured so as to protect the animal from injury and prevent the animal or tether from becoming entangled with other objects or animals, or from extending over an object or edge that could result in the strangulation or injury of the animal; is at least 15 feet in length or four times the length of the animal, as measured from the tip of its nose to the base of its tail, whichever is greater, except when the animal is being walked on a leash or is attached by a tether to a lead line or when an animal control officer, having inspected an animal's individual circumstances, has determined that in such an individual case, a tether of at least 10 feet or three times the length of the animal, but shorter than 15 feet or four times the length of the animal, makes the animal more safe, more suited, and better equipped to tolerate its environment than a longer tether; does not, by its material, size, or weight or any other characteristic, cause injury or pain to the animal; does not weigh more than one-tenth of the animal's body weight; and does not have weights or other heavy objects attached to it. The walking of an animal on a leash by its owner shall not constitute the tethering of the animal for the purpose of this definition. When freedom of movement would endanger the animal, temporarily and appropriately restricting movement of the animal according to professionally accepted standards for the species is considered provision of adequate space. The provisions of this definition that relate to tethering shall not apply to agricultural animals.

      <p>
       "Adequate water"

If the companion animal is licensed, the officer has the discretion, but not the duty, to capture and confine it. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Robert D.

    - A locality lawfully may operate a capture and sterilization program for the purpose of controlling a population of feral cats. The feral cats may be captured in a humane fashion, and such captured cats may be sterilized by a licensed veterinarian. The feral cats, however, may not be released by the locality back to the location from whence they came or some other location in the wild.

     Contempt proceedings.

    - A juvenile and domestic relations (JDR) court may enforce, through indirect contempt proceedings, a provision of an emergency protective order granting the petitioner the possession of a companion animal when a magistrate has issued the protective order. The contempt proceedings may be initiated by a JDR court through the issuance of a show cause summons. A JDR court has discretion in imposing punishment for a violation of a companion animal provision in a protective order, but the punishment may not exceed a jail sentence in excess of six months or a fine in excess of $500 without affording the defendant the right to trial by jury.

       Any locality may by ordinance prohibit the running at large of all or any category of dogs, except dogs used for hunting, in all or any designated portion of such locality during such months as it may designate. Any such locality may also require that dogs be confined, restricted, or penned up during such periods. For the purpose of this section, a dog shall be deemed to run at large while roaming or running off the property of its owner or custodian and not under its owner's or custodian's immediate control. Any person who permits his dog to run at large or remain unconfined, unrestricted, or not penned up shall be deemed to have violated an ordinance adopted pursuant to the provisions of this section. Such ordinance shall provide that the owner or custodian of any dog found running at large in a pack shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount established by the locality not to exceed $100 per dog so found. For the purpose of such ordinance, a dog shall be deemed to be running at large in a pack if it is running at large in the company of one or more other dogs that are also running at large. Any civil penalty collected pursuant to such ordinance shall be deposited by the treasurer of the locality pursuant to the provisions of § 3.2-6534.

       The governing body of any locality may adopt ordinances requiring that dogs within any such locality be kept on a leash or otherwise restrained and may, by resolution directed to the circuit court, request the court to order a referendum as to whether any such ordinance so adopted shall become effective. Such referendum shall be held and conducted, and the results thereof ascertained and certified in accordance with § 24.2-684. The court shall require the governing body to give appropriate notice of the time, place and subject matter of such referendum.

        As used in this section, "dog" includes a hybrid canine as defined in § 3.2-6581.
       </li>
       <li id="t3.2s0Vc65a06s3.2-6540ol1B">
        Any law-enforcement officer or animal control officer who (i) has reason to believe that an animal is a dangerous dog and (ii) is located in the jurisdiction where the animal resides or in the jurisdiction where the act was committed may apply to a magistrate for the issuance of a summons requiring the owner, if known, to appear before a general district court at a specified time. The summons shall advise the owner of the nature of the proceeding and the matters at issue.
       </li>
       <li id="t3.2s0Vc65a06s3.2-6540ol1C">
        No law-enforcement officer or animal control officer shall apply for a summons pursuant to subsection B if, upon investigation, the officer finds (i) in the case of an injury to a companion animal that is a dog or cat, that no serious injury has occurred as a result of the attack or bite, that both animals are owned by the same person, or that the incident originated on the property of the attacking or biting dog's owner or (ii) in the case of an injury to a person, that the injury caused by the dog upon the person consists solely of a single nip or bite resulting only in a scratch, abrasion, or other minor injury. In determining whether serious injury to a companion animal that is a dog or cat has occurred, the officer may consult with a licensed veterinarian.
       </li>
       <li id="t3.2s0Vc65a06s3.2-6540ol1D">
        A law-enforcement officer or animal control officer who applies for a summons pursuant to subsection B shall provide the owner with written notice of such application. For 30 days following such provision of written notice, the owner shall not dispose of the animal other than by surrender to the animal control officer or by euthanasia by a licensed veterinarian. Following such provision of written notice, an owner who elects to euthanize a dog that is the subject of a dangerous dog investigation shall provide documentation of such euthanasia to the animal control officer.
       </li>
       <li id="t3.2s0Vc65a06s3.2-6540ol1E">
        If a law-enforcement officer successfully makes an application for the issuance of a summons pursuant to subsection B, he shall contact the local animal control officer and inform him of the location of the dog and the relevant facts pertaining to his belief that the dog is dangerous.

       <li id="t3.2s0Vc65a06s3.2-6540ol1F">
        Following the issuance of a summons following an application pursuant to subsection B, an animal control officer may confine the animal until the evidence is heard and a verdict rendered. If the animal control officer determines that the owner can confine the animal in a manner that protects the public safety, he may permit the owner to confine the animal until the evidence is heard and a verdict rendered. Upon being served with a summons for a dangerous dog, the owner shall not dispose of the animal, other than by euthanasia, until the case has been adjudicated. The court, through its contempt powers, may compel the owner of the animal to produce the animal and to provide documentation that it has been, or will be within three business days, implanted with electronic identification registered to the owner. The owner shall provide the registration information to the animal control officer.

        Nothing in this section shall prohibit an animal control officer or law-enforcement officer from securing a summons for a hearing to determine whether a dog that is surrendered but not euthanized is a dangerous dog.

        Unless good cause is determined by the court, the evidentiary hearing pursuant to the dangerous dog summons shall be held not more than 30 days from the issuance of the summons. The procedure for appeal and trial shall be the same as provided by law for misdemeanors. Trial by jury shall be as provided in Article 4 (§ 19.2-260 et seq.) of Chapter 15 of Title 19.2. The Commonwealth shall be required to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court shall determine that the animal is a dangerous dog if the evidence shows that it (i) killed a companion animal that is a dog or cat or inflicted serious injury on a companion animal that is a dog or cat, including a serious impairment of health or bodily function that requires significant medical attention, a serious disfigurement, any injury that has a reasonable potential to cause death, or any injury other than a sprain or strain or (ii) directly caused serious injury to a person, including laceration, broken bone, or substantial puncture of skin by teeth. Unless good cause is determined by the court, the appeal of a dangerous dog finding shall be heard within 30 days.

          May order the owner of the animal to pay restitution for actual damages to any person injured by the animal or whose companion animal was injured or killed by the animal.

         </li>
         <li id="t3.2s0Vc65a06s3.2-6540ol1I3">
          May order the owner to pay all reasonable expenses incurred in caring and providing for such dangerous dog from the time the animal is taken into custody until such time as the animal is disposed of or returned to the owner.

        If after hearing the evidence the court decides to defer further proceedings without entering an adjudication that the animal is a dangerous dog, it may do so, notwithstanding any other provision of this section. A court that defers further proceedings shall place specific conditions upon the owner of the dog, including the requirement that the owner provide documentation that the dog has been, or will be within three business days, implanted with electronic identification registered to the owner. The registration information shall be provided to the animal control officer. If the owner violates any of the conditions, the court may enter an adjudication that the animal is a dangerous dog and proceed as otherwise provided in this section. Upon fulfillment of the conditions, the court shall dismiss the proceedings against the animal and the owner without an adjudication that the animal is a dangerous dog.

         Dangerous dog proceeding civil in nature.
        </b>
        - In a case where a jury found appellant's dog to be dangerous, and the trial court ordered appellant to comply with registration and maintenance provisions and to make restitution, the underlying proceeding and appeal were civil in nature as appellant sustained no criminal conviction; thus, because the current appeal was civil in nature, the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider it, and the court of appeals transferred the case to the Supreme Court of Virginia. O'Malley v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. App. 296, 785 S.E.2d 221 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme court had appellate jurisdiction over an order finding that a dog was dangerous within the meaning of subsection A of
    
     §
    
    3.2-6540 because an appeal under subsection B of
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    3.2-6540 was civil in nature and, by operation of
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    8.01-670, the supreme court had appellate jurisdiction. Frouz v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">296 Va. 391</cite>, 821 S.E.2d 324, 2018 Va. LEXIS 175 (2018).

     Safe harbor rule.
    </b>
    - Words of the statute are "unambiguous," and the definition of "occurs" as used in the statute is, therefore, not limited to the place where the attack initiated, but rather, the attack "occurs" at every location where it takes place; if the attack is confined to the dog's property, the safe harbor applies, however, once it extends beyond the owner or custodian's property, the safe harbor no longer applies. Frouz v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">296 Va. 391</cite>, 821 S.E.2d 324, 2018 Va. LEXIS 175 (2018).

     "Custodian."
    </b>
    - Determination that the mother of a dog owner was the custodian or harborer of the dog was not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it because the mother owned the house, and she referred to the dog as "my dog" after the attack and during her testimony. Frouz v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">296 Va. 391</cite>, 821 S.E.2d 324, 2018 Va. LEXIS 175 (2018).

        <b>
     Restitution.
    </b>
    - Circuit court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the mother of a dog's owner to pay a neighbor restitution because serious physical injury occurred to the neighbor's dog as a result of a bite of the owner's dog. Frouz v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">296 Va. 391</cite>, 821 S.E.2d 324, 2018 Va. LEXIS 175 (2018).

        <b>
     Failure to preserve error.
    </b>
    - Appellate court declined to address the merits of defendant's assignment of error because defendant never timely objected to defendant's sentence for criminal conviction or the condition under which it was suspended, nor did defendant assign error to them when she previously appealed to the appellate court. Therefore, defendant waived whatever alleged errors the circuit court may have made, and any unpreserved and unappealed errors became the law of the case and were binding on the parties in defendant's subsequent appeal.

         Landlord's duty to passerby.
        </b>
        - Pedestrian's case against a landlord arising from an attack by two dogs owned by the landlord's tenant was dismissed because the landlord had no duty to protect a passerby from the tenant's dogs; among other things, although the pedestrian alleged that the landlord should have known that the tenant's pit bulls were dangerous, subsection C of
        §
        3.2-6540 was indicative of the policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia not to designate a particular breed as being dangerous. Walisser v. Harris, 81 Va. Cir. 14, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 248 (Nelson County Feb. 26, 2010).

         Dangerous dog proceeding civil in nature.
        </b>
        - In a matter arising out of a dog bite incident giving rise to a dangerous dog proceeding, defendant's motion to suppress was denied because, based on a plain meaning textual analysis, the character of the penalties in a dangerous dog proceeding, and an understanding of the underlying purposes of the exclusionary rule, the dangerous dog proceeding should be treated as a civil proceeding, which thus barred application of the exclusionary rule to the dangerous dog proceeding. Commonwealth v. Shafer, 91 Va. Cir. 234, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 160 (Fairfax County Sept. 28, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Dangerous dog proceeding is civil and not criminal in nature, and the exclusionary rule does not apply because, if a dog is classified as a dangerous dog, the statute imposes conditions on owning the dog but the requirements are not intended to impose an affirmative disability or restraint that reaches the level of a criminal penalty; the provisions allowing a court to order actual damages to an injured party and reasonable expenses incurred are much more civil in nature and do not approach the retribution or deterrence aims of criminal punishment; and there is no crime in owning a dangerous dog. Commonwealth v. Shafer, 91 Va. Cir. 234, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 160 (Fairfax County Sept. 28, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Characterization of the dangerous dog proceeding was in contrast to the object of a forfeiture proceeding, which was to penalize a party for the commission of an offense against the law; thus, defendant was not penalized for ownership of the dog at issue; defendant was not permanently deprived ownership of the dog; and the temporary taking of the animal was authorized by the statute. Commonwealth v. Shafer, 91 Va. Cir. 234, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 160 (Fairfax County Sept. 28, 2015).

         Authority of animal control officer.
        </b>
        - Where an animal control officer has an objective reason to believe that a dog has bitten, attacked, or inflicted injury on a person, he must apply to a magistrate for issuance of a summons for violation of the dangerous dog statute. Only a court, and not an animal control officer, may determine, after consideration of the evidence, whether the exceptions and defenses found in subsections A and C of
        §
        3.2-6540 are applicable. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Paul B. Ebert, Commonwealth's Attorney, Prince William County, 16-009, 2016 Va. AG LEXIS 19 (9/1/16).

        Any law-enforcement officer or animal control officer who has reason to believe that a canine or canine crossbreed within his jurisdiction is a vicious dog shall apply to a magistrate serving the jurisdiction for the issuance of a summons requiring the owner or custodian, if known, to appear before a general district court at a specified time. The summons shall advise the owner of the nature of the proceeding and the matters at issue. If a law-enforcement officer successfully makes an application for the issuance of a summons, he shall contact the local animal control officer and inform him of the location of the dog and the relevant facts pertaining to his belief that the dog is vicious. The animal control officer shall confine the animal until such time as evidence shall be heard and a verdict rendered. The court, through its contempt powers, may compel the owner, custodian, or harborer of the animal to produce the animal. If, after hearing the evidence, the court finds that the animal is a vicious dog, the court shall order the animal euthanized in accordance with the provisions of § 3.2-6562. The court, upon finding the animal to be a vicious dog, may order the owner, custodian, or harborer thereof to pay restitution for actual damages to any person injured by the animal or to the estate of any person killed by the animal. The court, in its discretion, may also order the owner to pay all reasonable expenses incurred in caring and providing for such vicious dog from the time the animal is taken into custody until such time as the animal is disposed of. The procedure for appeal and trial shall be the same as provided by law for misdemeanors. Trial by jury shall be as provided in Article 4 (§ 19.2-260 et seq.) of Chapter 15 of Title 19.2. The Commonwealth shall be required to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

        No canine or canine crossbreed shall be found to be a vicious dog solely because it is a particular breed, nor is the ownership of a particular breed of canine or canine crossbreed prohibited. No animal shall be found to be a vicious dog if the threat, injury, or damage was sustained by a person who was (i) committing, at the time, a crime upon the premises occupied by the animal's owner or custodian; (ii) committing, at the time, a willful trespass upon the premises occupied by the animal's owner or custodian; or (iii) provoking, tormenting, or physically abusing the animal, or can be shown to have repeatedly provoked, tormented, abused, or assaulted the animal at other times. No police dog that was engaged in the performance of its duties as such at the time of the acts complained of shall be found to be a vicious dog.

The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any animal that, at the time of the acts complained of, was responding to pain or injury or was protecting itself, its kennel, its offspring, a person, or its owner's or custodian's property, or when the animal is a police dog that is engaged in the performance of its duties at the time of the attack.

Indoor areas shall have a solid floor. Each operator or custodian shall ensure adequate access to water, food, and a resting platform, bedding, or perch as appropriate to the animal's species, age, and condition.

        It shall be the duty of any animal control officer or other officer who may find a dog in the act of killing or injuring livestock or poultry to seize or kill such dog forthwith whether such dog bears a tag or not. Any person finding a dog committing any of the depredations mentioned in this section shall have the right to kill such dog on sight as shall any owner of livestock or his agent finding a dog chasing livestock on land utilized by the livestock when the circumstances show that such chasing is harmful to the livestock. Any court shall have the power to order the animal control officer or other officer to kill any dog known to be a confirmed livestock or poultry killer, and any dog killing poultry for the third time shall be considered a confirmed poultry killer.

Any animal control officer or other person who has reason to believe that any dog is killing livestock, or committing any of the depredations mentioned in this section, shall apply to a magistrate serving the locality wherein the dog may be, who shall issue a warrant requiring the owner or custodian, if known, to appear before a general district court at a time and place named therein, at which time evidence shall be heard. If it shall appear that the dog is a livestock killer, or has committed any of the depredations mentioned in this section, the district court shall order that the dog be (i) killed or euthanized immediately by the animal control officer or other officer designated by the court or (ii) removed to another state that does not border on the Commonwealth and prohibited from returning to the Commonwealth. Any dog ordered removed from the Commonwealth that is later found in the Commonwealth shall be ordered by a court to be killed or euthanized immediately.

The structure shall be designed to provide the dog with shelter from the elements of nature. When off its owner's property, any dog found to be a poultry killer shall be kept on a leash and muzzled in such a manner as not to cause injury to the dog or interfere with its vision or respiration, but so as to prevent it from biting a person or another animal.

        - An animal control officer is under a duty to remove an unlicensed companion animal from a property owner's property upon complaint from the property owner, where the animal is not owned by the property owner. If the companion animal is licensed, the officer has the discretion, but not the duty, to capture and confine it. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Robert D.

In no event shall the determination as to disposition of the animal be delayed beyond 48 hours after such humane investigator first decides the animal should be euthanized.

    - Evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that defendant committed cruelty to animals by failing to provide emergency veterinary treatment necessary for the dog; the trial court reasonably inferred that the dog's condition was so advanced that, in the three-week period during which the dog was missing, the worm eggs could not have entered the dog's system, matured into adult worms, and caused a near 20-percent weight loss.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of felony cruelty to animals for the death of a puppy as he voluntarily acted with a consciousness that inhumane injury or pain would result because defendant would have easily noticed the puppy's debilitating condition; the puppy starved to death over the course of<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.02.html#t02c2-3" target="_blank"> 2-3</a></cite> weeks, an easily prevented condition; the puppy was infected with parasites; there were no food or water bowls available to the puppy; defendant knew the puppy had been sick for at least a week and admitted to watching the puppy die, but did not take him for treatment as he did not think he could afford it; and most of the puppy's conditions were preventable with food, water, and general medical care that most puppies got.

        Trial court properly convicted defendant of assault and battery on a law enforcement officer, assault and battery, and animal cruelty because, each time the police officers attempted to effectuate an arrest, defendant clenched his fists, took a step toward them, took a fighting stance, and made threatening statements, the officers' testimony and actions demonstrated that they reasonably feared a threat of bodily injury, defendant's overt act of moving towards the victim while threatening to kill him was sufficient to establish the elements of assault and battery, and there was evidence that defendant voluntarily acted with a consciousness that inhumane injury or pain would result from punching and kicking a police dog while resisting a lawful arrest.

    - Evidence supported defendant's conviction for promoting or preparing for dog-fighting because (1) expert witnesses testified about the physical evidence seized from defendant's property, which they described as items used in the breeding of fighting dogs; (2) defendant had numerous dog-fighting publications and journals, some of which publications contained defendant's own advertisements using language relating to dog-fighting; and (3) the jury found the prosecution's witnesses more credible than defendant.

The Commonwealth was not required to prove that defendant engaged in organized dog fighting, but could prove in the alternative that he possessed, owned, trained, transported, or sold any dog with the intent that such dog engage in an exhibition of fighting with another dog; based upon the number of dogs that were there, the way they were restrained, the apparatus the dogs had on, the equipment that was found in the yard, the treadmill, the supplements, the medicine, and the literature that talked about how to train dogs to fight, which paralleled what was actually at the scene, the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the person in charge and control of the premises when the alleged acts occurred.

      <p>
       It shall be the duty of any animal control officer or other officer who may find a hybrid canine in the act of killing or injuring livestock or poultry to kill such hybrid canine forthwith, whether such hybrid canine bears a tag or not. Any person finding a hybrid canine committing any of the depredations mentioned in this section may kill such hybrid canine on sight as may any owner of livestock or his agent finding a hybrid canine chasing livestock on land lawfully utilized by the livestock when the circumstances show that such chasing is harmful to the livestock. Any court may order the animal control officer or other officer to kill any hybrid canine known to be a confirmed livestock or poultry killer, and any hybrid canine that kills poultry for a third time shall be considered a confirmed poultry killer. The court, through its contempt powers, may compel the owner, custodian, or harborer of the hybrid canine to produce the hybrid canine.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Any animal control officer who has reason to believe that any hybrid canine is killing livestock or poultry shall be empowered to seize such hybrid canine solely for the purpose of examining such hybrid canine in order to determine whether it committed any of the depredations mentioned herein. Any animal control officer or other person who has reason to believe that any hybrid canine is killing livestock, or committing any of the depredations mentioned in this section, shall apply to a magistrate serving the locality where such hybrid canine may be, who shall issue a warrant requiring the owner or custodian, if known, to appear before a general district court, at which time evidence shall be heard. If it appears that the hybrid canine is a livestock killer, or has committed any of the depredations mentioned in this section, the district court shall order that the hybrid canine be: (i) killed immediately by the animal control officer or other officer designated by the court; or (ii) removed to another state that does not border on the Commonwealth and prohibited from returning to the Commonwealth. Any hybrid canine ordered removed from the Commonwealth that is later found in the Commonwealth shall be ordered by a court to be killed immediately.

       Any person who has any livestock or poultry killed or injured by any hybrid canine not his own shall be entitled to receive as compensation the fair market value of such livestock or poultry not to exceed $750 per animal or $10 per fowl if (i) the claimant has furnished evidence within 60 days of discovery of the quantity and value of the dead or injured livestock and the reasons the claimant believes that death or injury was caused by a hybrid canine; (ii) the animal control officer or other officer shall have been notified of the incident within 72 hours of its discovery; and (iii) the claimant first has exhausted his legal remedies against the owner, if known, of the hybrid canine doing the damage for which compensation under this section is sought. Exhaustion shall mean a judgment against the owner of the hybrid canine upon which an execution has been returned unsatisfied.

       Local jurisdictions may by ordinance waive the requirements of clause (ii) or (iii) or both provided that the ordinance adopted requires that the animal control officer has conducted an investigation and that his investigation supports the claim. Upon payment under this section the local governing body shall be subrogated to the extent of compensation paid to the right of action to the owner of the livestock or poultry against the owner of the hybrid canine and may enforce the same in an appropriate action at law.

      <p>
       All dogs and cats shall be deemed personal property and may be the subject of larceny and malicious or unlawful trespass. Owners, as defined in § 3.2-6500, may maintain any action for the killing of any such animals, or injury thereto, or unlawful detention or use thereof as in the case of other personal property. The owner of any dog or cat that is injured or killed contrary to the provisions of this chapter by any person shall be entitled to recover the value thereof or the damage done thereto in an appropriate action at law from such person.

      <p>
       An animal control officer or other officer finding a stolen dog or cat, or a dog or cat held or detained contrary to law, shall have authority to seize and hold such animal pending action before a general district court or other court. If no such action is instituted within seven days, the animal control officer or other officer shall deliver the dog or cat to its owner.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The presence of a dog or cat on the premises of a person other than its legal owner shall raise no presumption of theft against the owner, and the animal control officer may take such animal and notify its legal owner. The legal owner of the animal shall pay a reasonable charge as the local governing body by ordinance shall establish for the keep of such animal while in the possession of the animal control officer.

     Damages for injuries related to service dogs.

    - Although an injured dog owner claimed that her dog, which was also hurt in the accident in which she was injured, was a service dog under
    
     §
    
    51.5-44, the trial court ruled that a jury instruction that allowed the jury to award the owner damages for the emotional distress she suffered in seeing the dog hurt was an impermissible instruction. As the court explained, dogs and cats were deemed to be personal property and no damages could be awarded for any emotional distress suffered due to an injury to personal property. Kondaurov v.
