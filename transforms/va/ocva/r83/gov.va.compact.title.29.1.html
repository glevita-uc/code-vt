        (b)
    It is the policy of the participating states to:

        (1) Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, regulations, rules, and ordinances relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states;
       </p>
       <p>
        (2) Recognize a suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a participating state and treat that suspension as if it had occurred in each respective state;
       </p>
       <p>
        (3) Allow a violator, except as provided in Article III, subsection (b) of this compact, to accept a wildlife citation and, without delay, proceed on the person's way, regardless of the violator's home state, if that state is a party to this compact;
       </p>
       <p>
        (4) Report to the appropriate participating state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against a person whose home state was not the issuing state;
       </p>
       <p>
        (5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded against its residents, which convictions occurred in a participating state, as though they had occurred in the home state;
       </p>
       <p>
        (6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the participating states for enforcing compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one participating state to a resident of another participating state;
       </p>
       <p>
        (7) Maximize the effective use of law-enforcement personnel and information; and
       </p>
       <p>
        (8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.
       </p>
       <p>
        (c)
    The purpose of this compact is to:
       </p>
       <p>
        (1) Provide a means through which participating states may join in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in subsection (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner; and
       </p>
       <p>
        (2) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within participating states in recognition of the violator's right to due process and the sovereign status of a participating state.
