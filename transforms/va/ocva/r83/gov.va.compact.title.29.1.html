       <p>
        Findings, Declaration of Policy, and Purpose
       </p>
       <p>
        (a)
    The participating states find that:
       </p>
       <p>
        (1) Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors;
       </p>
       <p>
        (2) The protection of the wildlife resources of a state is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statutes, laws, regulations, rules, and ordinances relating to the management of those resources;
       </p>
       <p>
        (3) The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of such natural resources;
       </p>
       <p>
        (4) Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries; therefore, every person should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and restoration statutes, laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances of the participating states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife;
       </p>
       <p>
        (5) Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property;
       </p>
       <p>
        (6) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communication among the various states;
       </p>
       <p>
        (7) In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the person's home state:
       </p>
       <p>
        (i) Is required to post collateral or a bond to secure an appearance for a trial at a later date;
       </p>
       <p>
        (ii) Is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or
       </p>
       <p>
        (iii) Is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance;
       </p>
       <p>
        (8) The purpose of the enforcement practices set forth in paragraph (7) of this subsection is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the cited person who, if permitted to continue on the person's way after receiving the citation, could return to the person's home state and disregard any duty under the terms of the citation;
       </p>
       <p>
        (9) In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the person's home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and immediately continue on the person's way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation;
       </p>
       <p>
        (10) The practices described in paragraph (7) of this subsection cause unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay a fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement is made; and
       </p>
       <p>
        (11) The enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subsection consume an undue amount of law-enforcement time.
       </p>
       <p>
        (b)
    It is the policy of the participating states to:
       </p>
       <p>
        (1) Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, regulations, rules, and ordinances relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states;
       </p>
       <p>
        (2) Recognize a suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a participating state and treat that suspension as if it had occurred in each respective state;
       </p>
       <p>
        (3) Allow a violator, except as provided in Article III, subsection (b) of this compact, to accept a wildlife citation and, without delay, proceed on the person's way, regardless of the violator's home state, if that state is a party to this compact;
       </p>
       <p>
        (4) Report to the appropriate participating state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against a person whose home state was not the issuing state;
       </p>
       <p>
        (5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded against its residents, which convictions occurred in a participating state, as though they had occurred in the home state;
       </p>
       <p>
        (6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the participating states for enforcing compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one participating state to a resident of another participating state;
       </p>
       <p>
        (7) Maximize the effective use of law-enforcement personnel and information; and
       </p>
       <p>
        (8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.
       </p>
       <p>
        (c)
    The purpose of this compact is to:
       </p>
       <p>
        (1) Provide a means through which participating states may join in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in subsection (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner; and
       </p>
       <p>
        (2) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within participating states in recognition of the violator's right to due process and the sovereign status of a participating state.

        Procedures for Issuing State
       </p>
       <p>
        (a)
    When issuing a citation for a wildlife violation, a wildlife officer shall issue a citation to any person whose primary residence is in a participating state in the same manner as though the person were a resident of the issuing state and shall not require such person to post collateral to secure appearance, subject to the exceptions noted in subsection (b) of this article, if the officer receives the recognizance of such person that he will comply with the terms of the citation.
       </p>
       <p>
        (b)
    Personal recognizance is acceptable if not prohibited by local law; by policy, procedure, or regulation of the issuing agency; or by the compact manual and if the violator provides adequate proof of identification to the wildlife officer.
