       Liability arising out of sales transaction occurring before effective date.
      </b>
      - The "transaction or event" language of this section plainly was intended to identify the point at which substantive duties were created under the Uniform Commercial Code. Where substantive duties were fixed by a sales transaction occurring before the effective date of the Code, liability was correctly determined under pre-Code case law. Farish v. Courion Indus., Inc., 722 F.2d 74 (4th Cir. 1983), aff'd on reh'g en banc, 754 F.2d 1111 (4th Cir. 1985).

      The title on documents of title (Title 8.7) does not repeal or modify any laws prescribing the form or contents of documents of title or the services or facilities to be afforded by bailees, or otherwise regulating bailees' businesses in respects not specifically dealt with herein; but the fact that such laws are violated does not affect the status of a document of title which otherwise complies with the definition of a document of title (§ 8.1A-201).

      This section subordinates the Article of this Act on Documents of Title (Article (7)) to the more specialized regulations of particular classes of bailees under other legislation and international treaties. Particularly, the provisions of that Article are superseded by applicable inconsistent provisions regarding the obligation of carriers and the limitation of their liability found in federal legislation dealing with transportation by water (including the Harter Act, Act of February 13, 1893, 27 Stat. 445, and the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, Act of April 16, 1936, 49 Stat. 1207); the Warsaw Convention on International Air Transportation, 49 Stat. 3000, and Section 20(11) of the Interstate Commerce Act, Act of February 20, 1887, 24 Stat. 386, as amended. The Documents of Title provisions of this Act supplement such legislation largely in matters other than obligation of the bailee, e.g., form and effects of negotiation, procedure in the case of lost documents, effect of overissue, possibility of rapid transmission.
